3,chancellor rallies labour voters gordon brown has issued a rallying cry to supporters  warning the  stakes are too high  to stay at home or protest vote in the next general election.  the chancellor said the poll - expected to fall on 5 may - would give a  clear and fundamental  choice between labour investment and tory cuts. he told his party s spring conference the tories must not be allowed to win. the conservatives and lib dems insisted that voters faced higher taxes and means-testing under labour.  to a packed audience at gateshead s sage centre  mr brown accused shadow chancellor oliver letwin of plotting cuts that were the equivalent of sacking every teacher  gp and nurse in the country. laying into the conservative s record in government he said:  i give you this promise - with labour  britain will never return to the mistakes of erm and 10% inflation  15% interest rates  £3bn in lost reserves  250 000 repossessed  one million in negative equity and three million unemployed.  never again tory boom and bust.   this will be the central dividing line at the election  between a conservative party taking britain back and planning deep cuts of £35bn in our services  and a labour government taking britain forward  which on a platform of stability will reform and renew our hospitals  schools and public services and  i am proud to say  spend by 2008 £60bn more.  turning to the economy  the chancellor promised to continue economic stability and growth in a third term in power.  he also pledged to continue the fight against child and pensioner poverty. and he promised help to get young people on the property ladder.  my message to the thousands of young couples waiting to obtain their first home is that housing is rightly now at the centre of our coming manifesto   he said.  and the next labour government will match our low mortgage rates with a new first-time buyers  initiative.  in the speech  which prompted a standing ovation  he also promised to end teenage unemployment within the next five years.  he also highlighted plans for 100% debt relief for the world s poorest countries  a national minimum wage for 16 and 17-year-olds  the creation of a network of children s centres and flexibility in maternity leave. responding to the speech  shadow chief secretary to the treasury  george osborne  said:  this was more talk from gordon brown.  we ve heard it all before. instead of talking about the future he kept on talking about the past.  he completely failed to say which taxes he would put up to fill the black hole in his spending plans.  there will be a simple choice at the election - value for money and lower taxes with the conservatives  or more waste and higher taxes under tony blair and gordon brown.   liberal democrat shadow chancellor vince cable warned the picture was not as rosy as mr brown would like to portray it.  for all his trumpeting of labour s management of the economy  gordon brown s record is very mixed   he said.  gordon brown has created a system of massive centralisation and bureaucracy  a system which subjects millions of people to means testing  and a system of taxation which is extremely complex.  for all his positive words  gordon brown is faced with economic problems looming on the horizon  not least the unprecedented levels of personal debt facing the nation.  also in gateshead  the prime minister took questions sent in by e-mail  text message and telephone as part of labour s attempt to engage the public in their campaign. mr blair told the audience he believed the iraq war would have made britain a safer place if its emerging democracy succeeded and that he wanted to bring troops home as soon as possible  but not before the job was done. he also said he wanted to carry on as pm  because i still think that there are big changes our country needs .,politics

5,s korean lender faces liquidation creditors of south korea s top credit card firm have said they will put the company into liquidation if its ex-parent firm fails to back a bail-out.  lg card s creditors have given lg group until wednesday to sign up to a $1.1bn rescue package. the firm avoided bankruptcy thanks to a $4.5bn bail-out in january 2004  which gave control to the creditors. lg group has said any package should reflect the firm s new ownership  and it will not accept an unfair burden. at least seven million people in south korea use lg card s plastic for purchases.  lg card s creditors have threatened parent group lg group with penalties if it fails to respond to their demands.   creditors would seek strong financial sanctions against lg group if lg card is liquidated   said yoo ji-chang  governor of korean development bank (kdb) - one of the card firm s major creditors. lg group has said providing further help to the credit card issuer could hurt its corporate credibility and could spark shareholder lawsuits. it says it wants  fair and reasonable guidelines  on splitting the financial burden with the creditors  who now own 99.3% of lg card. the creditors have asked the government to mediate to avoid any risk to the stability of financial markets  kdb said. analysts believe a compromise is likely.  lg group knows the impact on consumer demand and the national economy from a liquidation of lg card   said kim yungmin  an equity strategist at dongwon investment trust management.  lg card almost collapsed in 2003 due to an increase in overdue credit card bills after the bursting of a credit bubble. the firm returned to profit in september 2004  but now needs a capital injection to avoid being delisted from the korea stock exchange. the exchange can delist a company if its debt exceeds its assets for two years running. lg card s creditors fear that such a move would triggered massive debt redemption requests that could bankrupt the firm  which owes about $12.05bn.  eventually  lg group will have to participate  but they have been stalling to try to earn better concessions   said mr kim.,business
6,us to rule on yukos refuge call yukos has said a us bankruptcy court will decide whether to block russia s impending auction of its main production arm on thursday.  the russian oil firm has filed for bankruptcy protection in the us in an attempt to halt the forced sale. however  judge letitia clark said the hearing would continue on thursday when arguments in the case would be heard. russian authorities are due to auction off yuganskneftegas on 19 december to pay a huge tax bill sent to yukos.  russian prosecutors are forcing the sale of the firm s most lucrative asset yuganskneftegas to help pay a $27bn (£14bn) back tax bill  which they claim is owed by yukos.  filing for bankruptcy protection in the us was  a last resort to preserve the rights of our shareholders  employees and customers   said yukos chief executive steven theede. the company added it had opted to take action through american courts as us bankruptcy law gives worldwide jurisdiction over a debtor company s property and because it was seeking a judiciary willing to protect the value of shareholders  investments. however  as the firm is based in russia and has no significant us assets  lawyers are unsure of the outcome of the case.  we are here to stop 60% of our body from being cut off on sunday   zack clement  a lawyer for yukos  told judge clark in an emergency hearing in houston  texas  on wednesday. as well as the bid to get chapter 11 bankruptcy - which protects firms from creditors  allowing them to continue trading as they restructure their finances - the group also made a claim for damages against the russian government. yukos asked the houston court to order russia to arbitration so that it can press claims for billions of dollars in damages over a  campaign of illegal  discriminatory and disproportionate  tax claims. mr clement said that under russian law  the russian government was obliged to enter into arbitration as set out in international law.  he added that the opening bid for the firm s yuganskneftgas unit was $8bn - less than half of the $20bn that yukos advisers say it is worth.  we believe the only significant bidder at the auction on sunday is gazprom   he said  referring to russia s natural gas giant. yukos maintains that the forced auction is illegal and  will cause the company to suffer immediate and irreparable harm.  many commentators believe the russian government s aggressive pursuit of yukos is a politically-motivated response to the political ambitions of its former chief executive  mikhail khodorkovsky. mr khodorkovsky  who had funded liberal opposition groups  was arrested in october last year on fraud and tax evasion charges and is still in jail analysts believe that if its production unit is auctioned off  it is likely to be bought up by a government-backed firm  like gazprom  effectively bringing a large chunk of russia s lucrative oil and gas industry back under state control.,business
7,mobile audio enters new dimension as mobile phones move closer to being a ubiquitous  all-in-one media player  audio is becoming ever more important. but how good can that sound be from such a small device   the sound of a buzzing bee jumps from left to right before disappearing around the back of my head. the surround sound demo is unremarkable when heard on a multi-speaker home cinema system but startling when emerging from a small mobile phone. british firm sonaptic is one of a number of companies to have developed 3d audio technology that emerges from stereo speakers. firms am3d and srs both offer stereo-widening technology for mobile phones. but sonaptic s managing director david monteith says his firm is the only company to offer positional 3d audio on a mobile.   there are quite a few basic technologies out there  making the sound seem a bit bigger  headphones a bit nicer.   no-one has really tried before to make proper 3d positional audio - where an individual channel can be moved around.  sonaptic has been working with japanese mobile network ntt docomo to set standards for 3d audio on mobile phones. in the last few months handsets from nec  fujitsu and mitsubishi have been released on to the japanese marker which have chips produced by yamaha and rohm with sonaptic s technology.  the technology has been around on pcs and games consoles for some time but what we are doing is making it more efficient so it can go on a small consumer device like a mobile phone   said mr monteith.  the technology works through applying the science of psychoacoustics and grew out of medical research done by the company s research director dr alastair sibbald.  we are basically trying to fool your ears into thinking sound is coming from areas it actually isn t.  your brain uses certain bits of information which we are effectively synthesising on a mobile phone handset.  the structure of the ear works as a 3d encoder for sound - helping the brain understand from where sound is emanating. sonaptic s audio processing algorithms mimic that 3d encoding  giving the impression that sound is coming from the left  right  and behind a listener when in fact it is coming from a single source. mr montieth says:  if the sound is off to one side it will get to one ear before the other - if it is on the right it has to bend around your head to get to your left ear.   the shape of your ear causes differences in sound from one ear to the other. we are synthesising those differences.  sonaptic hopes the technology will have a big impact in the growing market of mobile gaming and music downloading.  handhelds often have limitations - screens will be small by definition.  if you want to get impact from media you are running - either a movie  a game or watching tv - if you want it to be more immersive then our technology can help.  a fishing game is the first title to use the technology  creating a 3d sound field while the gamer plays. driving games and shoot  em ups using the technology are in development. the technology can also be used for music - giving songs a much more expansive and immersive feel. sonaptic offers its technology on a chip or in software and is about to release a new version which significantly improves the efficiency of the audio processing.  it s important we only use 10 or 15% of the processor otherwise you won t be able to play a game on the handset   explained mr montieth. the company is now looking to the us and european markets  where it has been working with network vodafone.  we have focused first on japan because it has a very advanced mobile phone market.  we knew japan would be the first place to have the handsets that could use our technology.  there should be handsets out in the uk in the next six months.,tech

9,us prepares for hybrid onslaught sales of hybrid cars in the us are set to double in 2005  research suggests.  research group jd power estimates sales will hit 200 000 in 2005  despite higher prices and customer scepticism. carmakers are starting to build hybrid sports utility vehicles (suvs)  the four-wheel-drive vehicles which now dominate the us car market. hybrids cut both petrol consumption and emissions by combining a petrol engine with an electric motor constantly kept charged by extra engine power. several jurisdictions  notably the state of california  mandate low emissions for new cars. equally  the rise in oil prices over the past year has sparked hopes that consumers may be tempted by potential savings of a few hundred dollars a year on fuel.  at the detroit motor show  a range of manufacturers are prominently displaying their hybrid credentials. toyota has led the market to date with the prius  popularised by a number of celebrities keen to burnish their  green  credentials. in april it will launch a hybrid version of its highlander suv  with an suv from its luxury lexus marque due later in the year.  honda has three hybrids on the market  and between them the two japanese carmakers sold more than 80 000 units last year. ford  which has sold 4 000 of its first hybrid since its launch in august  is bringing a hybrid suv - the mariner - to market a year ahead of schedule  with plans for three more models by 2008. gm has a hybrid pickup on the market and is showing two concept suvs in detroit. even sports car maker porsche may join the race  although it insists it is still considering whether to hybridise its cayenne suv.  others remain more sceptical. nissan has bought toyota s hybrid technology  but plans to bring out its first model only in 2006.  we want to make sure we are not concentrating on one technology   nissan chief executive carlos ghosn said.  we will not be surprised by any acceleration or deceleration in the hybrid market.  volkswagen  meanwhile  says it will focus on clean-burning diesel engines instead. and some watchers point out that the price tag on a hybrid - upwards of $3 000 above that of an equivalent normal-engined car  and suspicion of the technology - may still cool its attraction.  the average consumers aren t willing to pay that premium for a car they won t drive more than six years   said anthony pratt from jd power.,business

13,cabs collect mountain of mobiles gadgets are cheaper  smaller and more common than ever. but that just means we are more likely to lose them.  in london alone over the past six months more than 63 000 mobile phones have been left in the back of black cabs  according to a survey. that works out at about three phones per cab. over the same period almost 5 000 laptops and 5 800 pdas such as palms and pocket pcs were left in licensed cabs. even the great and good are not immune to losing their beloved gadgets. jemima khan reportedly left her ipod  phone and purse in a cab and asked for them to be returned to her friend who turned out to be hugh grant. as the popularity of portable gadgets has grown  and we trust more of our lives to them  we seem to be forgetting them in ever larger numbers. the numbers of lost laptops has leapt by 71% in the last three years.  this has left londoners  or those travelling by cab in the capital  as the world s best at losing laptops  according to the research by the licensed taxi drivers association and pointsec  a mobile-data backup firm. more than twice as many laptops were left in the back of black cabs in london as in any of the nine other cities (helsinki  oslo  munich  paris  stockholm  copenhagen  chicago and sydney) where the research into lost and found gadgets was carried out. by contrast danes were most adept at losing mobile phones being seven times more likely to leave it behind in a cab than travellers in germans  norwegians and swedes. top of the range phones can carry enormous amounts of data - enough to hold hundreds of pictures or thousands of contact details. given that few people back up the data on their pc it is a fair bet that even fewer do so with the phone they carry around. you could be losing a fair chunk of your life in the back of that cab not least because many people collect numbers on their phone that they do not have anywhere else.  equally  phones let you navigate through contacts by name so many people have completely forgotten their friends  numbers and could not reconstruct them if they had to. this growing habit of losing gadgets explains the rise of firms such as retrofone which lets people buy a cheap old-fashioned phone to replace the tiny  shiny expensive one they have just lost. briton s growing love of phones has also led to the creation of the mobile equipment national database that lets you register the unique id number of your phone so it can be returned to you in the event of it being lost or stolen. according to statistics 50% of all muggings and snatch theft offences involve mobiles. millions of gadgets are now logged in the database and organisations such as transport for london regularly consult it when trying to re-unite folk with their phones and other gadgets. for the drivers  finding a mobile in the back of their cab is one of the more pleasant things many have found. the survey of what else has been left behind included a harp  a dog  a hamster and a baby.,tech
14,2004: an irish athletics year 2004 won t be remembered as one of irish athletics  great years.  the year began with that optimism which invariably and unaccountably  seems to herald an upcoming olympiad. but come late august  a few hot days in the magnificent stadium in athens told us of the true strength of irish athletics - or to be more accurate  the lack of it. sonia o sullivan s olympic farewell apart  there was little to stir the emotions of irish athletics watchers. but after the disastrous build-up to the games  we shouldn t have been surprised. at the start of the year  an o sullivan had been earmarked as ireland s best medal prospect but as it turned out  walker gillian never even made it to the start line because of injury. less than a week before the olympics  the sport was rocked by news that 10 000m hope cathal lombard had tested for the banned substance epo. lombard s shattering of mark carroll s national 10 000m record in april had already set tongues wagging but even the most cynical of observers  were surprised when he was rumbled after an irish sports council sting operation. the corkman quickly held his hands up in admission and was promptly handed a two-year ban from the sport.  back at pre-olympic ranch in greece  it must have seemed that things couldn t have got any worse but they very nearly did with walker jamie costin lucky to escape with his life after being involved in a car crash near athens. once the track and field action began in athens  a familiar pattern of underachievement emerged although alistair cragg s performance in being the only athlete from a european nation to qualify for the 5 000m final did offer hope for the future. our beloved sonia scraped into the women s 5k final as a fastest loser and for a couple of days  the country attempted to delude itself into believing that she might be in the medal shake-up. as it happened  she went out the back door early in the final although there was nothing undignified about the way that she insisted on finishing the race over a minute behind winner meseret defar. it later transpired that sonia had been suffering from a stomach bug in the 48 hours before the final although typically  the cobhwoman played down the effects of the illness. amazingly  she was back in action a couple of weeks later when beating a world-class field at the flora lite 5k road race in london and while her major championship days may be over  it s unlikely that we have seen the last of her in competition. at least sonia managed to make it to athens. at the start of the year  several northern ireland athletes had genuine hopes of qualifying for the games but come august  an out-of-form and injured paul brizzel was the lone standard bearer for the province. the ballymena man gave it a lash but his achilles problem  and a bad lane draw  meant a time of 21.00 and an early exit.  james mcilroy  gareth turnbull  zoe brown and paul mckee all had to be content with watching the athens action on their television screens. 800m hope mcilroy never got near his best during the summer and a fourth place in the british trials effectively ended his hopes of making the plane. the injury-plagued turnbull gamely travelled round europe in search of the 1500m qualifying mark but 3:39 was the best he could achieve  after missing several months training during the previous winter. a lingering hamstring probem and a virus wrecked mckee s athens ambitions and both he and turnbull deserve a slice of better fortune in 2005. pole vaulter brown had hoped for a vote of confidence from the british selectors after she had achieved the athens b standard but the call never came. as the summer ended  stalwarts catherina mckiernan and dermot donnelly hung up their competitive spikes. mckiernan had to candidly acknowledge that time had crept up on her after several injury-ravaged years. donnelly and his annadale striders team-mates later suffered tragedy when their friend and clubman andy campbell was found dead at his home on 18 december. a large turnout of athletics-loving folk turned out in west belfast to offer their respects to the campbell family and andy s many friends. as only death can  it put the year s athletics happenings in a sharp perspective.,sport

on streets  in homes  in appliances  on our bodies and possibly in our heads - by things that  think . forget local area networks - these will be body area networks. ideas about just how smart  small  or even invisible  technology will get are always floating around. images of devices clumsily bolted on to heads or wrists have pervaded thinking about future technology. but now a new vision is surfacing  where smart fabrics and textiles will be exploited to enhance functionality  form  or aesthetics. such materials are already starting to change how gadgets and electronics are used and designed.  so mp3 players - the mass gadget of the moment - will disappear and instead become integrated into one s clothing  says mr pearson.  so the gadgets that fill up your handbag  when we integrate those into fabric  we can actually get rid of all that stuff. you won t necessarily see the electronics.  wearable technology could exploit body heat to charge it up  while  video tattoos   or intelligent electronic contact lenses  might function as tv screens for those on the move. however  this future of highly personal devices  where technology is worn  or even fuses with the body itself  raises ethical questions. if technology is going to be increasingly part of clothing  jewellery  and skin  there needs to be some serious thinking about what it means for us as humans  says baroness susan greenfield. at a recent conference for technology  engineering  academic and fashion industry experts  at the royal society in london  neuroscientist baroness greenfield cautioned we  can t just sleepwalk into the future .  yet this technology is already upon us. researchers have developed computers and sensors worn in clothing. mp3 jackets  based on the idea that electrically conductive fabric can connect to keyboard sewn into sleeves  have already appeared in shops.  these  smart fabrics  have come about through advances in nano- and micro-engineering - the ability to manipulate and exploit materials at micro or molecular scale. at the nanoscale  materials can be  tuned  to display unusual properties that can be exploited to build faster  lighter  stronger and more efficient devices and systems. the textile and clothing industry has been one of the first to exploit nanotechnology in quite straightforward ways. many developments are appearing in real products in the fields of medicine  defence  healthcare  sports  and communications. professional swimming suits reduce drag by incorporating tiny structures similar to shark skin. nanoscale titanium dioxide (tio2) coatings give fabrics antibacterial and anti-odour properties. these have special properties which can be activated in contact with the air or uv light. such coatings have already been used to stop socks smelling for instance  to turn airline seats into super stain-resistant surfaces  and applied to windows so they clean themselves. dressings for wounds can now incorporate nanoparticles with biocidal properties and smart patches are being developed to deliver drugs through the skin. but baroness greenfield is concerned about how far this more personal contact with technology might affect our very being. if our clothing  skin  and  personal body networks  do the talking and the monitoring  everywhere we go  we have to think about what that means for our concept of privacy. mr pearson picks up the theme  pointing out there are a lot of issues humans have to iron out before we become  cyborgian . his main concern is  privacy .  we are looking at electronics which are really in deep contact with your body and a lot of that information you really don t want every passer-by to know.  so we have to make sure we build security in this. if you are wearing smart make-up  where electronics are controlling the appearance  you don t want people hacking in and writing messages on your forehead.  as technology infiltrates our biology  how will our brains function differently   we cannot arrogantly assume that the human brain will not change with this   warns baroness greenfield. there have already been successful experiments to grow human nerve cells on circuit boards. this paves the way for brain implants to help paralysed people interface directly with computers. clearly  the organic  carbon of our bodies and silicon is increasingly merging. the cyborg - a very familiar part-human  part-inorganic science fiction and academic idea - is on its way.,tech
16,us trade gap hits record in 2004 the gap between us exports and imports hit an all-time high of $671.7bn (£484bn) in 2004  latest figures show.  the commerce department said the trade deficit for all of last year was 24.4% above the previous record - 2003 s imbalance of $496.5bn. the deficit with china  up 30.5% at $162bn  was the largest ever recorded with a single country. however  on a monthly basis the us trade gap narrowed by 4.9% in december to £56.4bn. the us consumer s appetite for all things from oil to imported cars  and even wine and cheese  reached record levels last year and the figures are likely to spark fresh criticism of president bush s economic policies.  democrats claim the administration has not done enough to clamp down on unfair foreign trade practices. for example  they believe china s currency policy - which us manufacturers claim has undervalued the yuan by as much as 40% - has given china s rapidly expanding economy an unfair advantage against us competitors.  meanwhile  the bush administration argues that the us deficit reflects the fact the america is growing at faster rate than the rest of the world  spurring on more demand for imported goods. some economists say this may allow an upward revision of us economic growth in the fourth quarter. but others point out that the deficit has reached such astronomical proportions that foreigners many choose not to hold as many dollar-denominated assets  which may in turn harm growth. for all of 2004  us exports rose 12.3% to $1.15 trillion  but imports rose even faster by 16.3% to a new record of $1.76 trillion. foreign oil exports surged by 35.7% to a record $180.7bn  reflecting the rally in global oil prices and increasing domestic demand. imports were not affected by the dollar s weakness last year.  we expect the deficit to continue to widen in 2005 even if the dollar gets back to its downward trend   said economist marie-pierre ripert at ixis.,business
17,early elvis recordings go on sale some of elvis presley s earliest recordings - including takes of all shook up - are going under the hammer on sunday at a los angeles auction.  the six unedited reel-to-reel tapes - which were owned by the engineer who recorded them - are valued at up to $50 000 (£29 000). highlights of the two hour-long collection will get their public debut at bonhams auction house on saturday. the rca tapes date from september 1956 to september 1957. the  pre-masters  include a take of jailhouse rock  religious songs  material for his first christmas album  and banter between presley  members of his band and engineer thorne nogar.   we ve had them for a lot of years  and i think the people should enjoy them   nogar s son stephen  57  said.  and frankly  we could use the money.  nogar  who died in 1994 aged 72  always used to make two tapes of sessions as a back-up in case rca producers wanted to make late changes to songs.  he called them his ass-saver tapes   his son said. the quality is said to be noticeably crisper than that of a new vinyl record. because the family does not own the copyright to the music  the tapes can only be sold for  personal enjoyment  and they cannot be copied for commercial gain.,entertainment
18,id theft surge hits us consumers almost a quarter of a million us consumers complained of being targeted for identity theft in 2004  official figures suggest.  the federal trade commission said two in five of the 635 173 reports it had from consumers concerned id fraud. id theft occurs when criminals use someone else s personal information to steal credit or commit other crimes. internet auctions were the second biggest source of fraud complaints  comprising 16% of the total. the total cost of fraud reported by consumers was $546m (£290m).  the report marks the fifth year in a row in which identity fraud has topped the table. the biggest slice of the 246 570 id fraud cases reported - almost 30% - concerned abuses of people s credit. misusing someone s identity to claim new credit cards or loans comprised 16.5% of the total  with almost 12% coming from false claims on existing credit. another 18% came from attempts to rip off people s bank accounts  while 13% of cases concerned attempts to defraud employers by abusing someone else s identity. outside the field of id theft  53% of the near-400 000 complaints were internet-related. among the 100 000 internet auction complaints  the failure of sellers to deliver or the supply of sub-standard goods were the most common woes reported. catalogue and home-shopping frauds were next in line  accounting for 8% of total complaints  while concerns about internet services and computers - including spyware found on people s pcs and undisclosed charges for websites - amounted to 6% of complaints.,business
19,hobbit picture  four years away  lord of the rings director peter jackson has said that it will be up to four years before he starts work on a film version of the hobbit.  the oscar winner said on a visit to sydney there was a  desire  to make it  but not before lengthy negotiations.  i think it s gonna be a lot of lawyers sitting in a room trying to thrash out a deal before it will ever happen   said the new zealander. the rights to jrr tolkien s book are split between two major film studios. jackson  who is currently filming a remake of hollywood classic king kong  said he thought that the sale of mgm studios to the sony corporation would cast further uncertainty on the project. the 43-year-old was in the australian city to visit a lord of the rings exhibition  which has attracted 140 000 visitors since it opened in december.  the film-maker recently sued film company new line cinema for undisclosed damages over alleged withheld profits and lost revenue from the first part of the middle earth trilogy. the fellowship of the ring from 2001 went on to make worldwide profits of $291 million (£152 million). jackson is thought to have secured the most lucrative film directing deal in history to remake king kong  which is currently in production in wellington. the picture  which stars naomi watts and oscar winner adrien brody  is due to be released in december. jackson has also committed to making a film version of lovely bones  based on the best-selling book by alice sebold.,entertainment
20,lifestyle  governs mobile choice  faster  better or funkier hardware alone is not going to help phone firms sell more handsets  research suggests.  instead  phone firms keen to get more out of their customers should not just be pushing the technology for its own sake. consumers are far more interested in how handsets fit in with their lifestyle than they are in screen size  onboard memory or the chip inside  shows an in-depth study by telecommunications company ericsson.  historically in the industry there has been too much focus on using technology   said dr michael bjorn  senior advisor on mobile media at ericsson s consumer and enterprise lab.  we have to stop saying that these technologies will change their lives   he said.  we should try to speak to consumers in their own language and help them see how it fits in with what they are doing   he told the bbc news website.  for the study  ericsson interviewed 14 000 mobile phone owners on the ways they use their phone.  people s habits remain the same   said dr bjorn.  they just move the activity into the mobile phone as it s a much more convenient way to do it.   one good example of this was diary-writing among younger people  he said. while diaries have always been popular  a mobile phone -- especially one equipped with a camera -- helps them keep it in a different form. youngsters  use of text messages also reflects their desire to chat and keep in contact with friends and again just lets them do it in a slightly changed way. dr bjorn said that although consumers do what they always did but use a phone to do it  the sheer variety of what the new handset technologies make possible does gradually drive new habits and lifestyles. ericsson s research has shown that consumers divide into different  tribes  that use phones in different ways. dr bjorn said groups dubbed  pioneers  and  materialists  were most interested in trying new things and were behind the start of many trends in phone use.  for instance   he said   older people are using sms much more than they did five years ago.  this was because younger users  often the children of ageing mobile owners  encouraged older people to try it so they could keep in touch.  another factor governing the speed of change in mobile phone use was the simple speed with which new devices are bought by pioneers and materialists. only when about 25% of people have handsets with new innovations on them  such as cameras  can consumers stop worrying that if they send a picture message the person at the other end will be able to see it.  once this significant number of users is passed  use of new innovations tends to take off. dr bjorn said that early reports of camera phone usage in japan seemed to imply that the innovation was going to be a flop. however  he said  now 45% of the japanese people ericsson questioned use their camera phone at least once a month. in 2003 the figure was 29%. similarly  across europe the numbers of people taking snaps with cameras is starting to rise. in 2003 only 4% of the people in the uk took a phonecam snap at least once a month. now the figure is 14%. similar rises have been seen in many other european nations. dr bjorn said that people also used their camera phones in very different ways to film and even digital cameras.  usage patterns for digital cameras are almost exactly replacing usage patterns for analogue cameras   he said. digital cameras tend to be used on significant events such as weddings  holidays and birthdays. by contrast  he said  camera phones were being used much more to capture a moment and were being woven into everyday life.,tech
21,china  to overtake us net use  the chinese net-using population looks set to exceed that of the us in less than three years  says a report.  china s net users number 100m but this represents less than 8% of the country s 1.3 billion people. market analysts panlogic predicts that net users in china will exceed the 137 million us users of the net by 2008. the report says that the country s culture will mean that chinese people will use the net for very different ends than in many other nations.  already net use in china has a very different character than in many western nations  said william makower  chief executive of panlogic. in many western nations desktop computers that can access the net are hard to escape at work. by contrast in china workplace machines are relatively rare. this  combined with the relatively high cost of pcs in china and the time it takes to get phone lines installed  helps to explains the huge number of net cafes in china. only 36% of chinese homes have telephones according to reports.  net usage tends to happen in the evening   said mr makower   they get access only when they go home and go off to the internet caf&#233;.   its fundamentally different usage to what we have here   he said.  net use in china was still very much an urban phenomenon with most users living on the country s eastern seaboard or in its three biggest cities. the net is key to helping chinese people keep in touch with friends  said mr makower. many people use it in preference to the phone or arrange to meet up with friends at net cafes. what people can do on the net is also limited by aspects of chinese life. for instance  said mr makower  credit cards are rare in china partly because of fears people have about getting in to debt.  the most popular way to pay is cash-on-delivery   he said   and that s quite a brake to the development of e-commerce.  the arrival of foreign banks in china  due in 2006  could mean greater use of credit cards but for the moment they are rare  said mr makower. but if chinese people are not spending cash online they are interested in the news they can get via the net and the view it gives them on western ways of living.  a large part of the attraction of the internet is that it goes below the radar   he said.  generally it s more difficult for the government to be able to control it.   its real value is as an open window onto what s happening elsewhere in the world   he said. government restrictions on how much advertising can appear on television means that the net is a source of many commercial messages chinese people would not see anywhere else. familiarity with the net also has a certain social cachet.  it s a sign of them having made it that they can use the internet and navigate around it   said mr makower.,tech

23,santy worm makes unwelcome visit thousands of website bulletin boards have been defaced by a virus that used google to spread across the net.  the santy worm first appeared on 20 december and within 24 hours had successfully hit more than 40 000 websites. the malicious program exploits a vulnerability in the widely used phpbb software. santy s spread has now been stopped after google began blocking infected sites searching for new victims.  the worm replaces chat forums with a webpage announcing that the site had been defaced by the malicious program. soon after being infected  sites hit by the worm started randomly searching for other websites running the vulnerable phpbb software. once google started blocking these search queries the rate of infection tailed off sharply. a message sent to finnish security firm f-secure by google s security team said:  while a seven hour response for something like this is not outrageous  we think we can and should do better.   we will be reviewing our procedures to improve our response time in the future to similar problems   the google team said. security firms estimate that about 1m websites run their discussion groups and forums with the open source phpbb program. the worst of the attack now seems to be over as a search conducted on the morning of the 22 december produced only 1 440 hits for sites showing the text used in the defacement message. people using the sites hit by santy will not be affected by the worm. santy is not the first malicious program to use google to help it spread. in july a variant of the mydoom virus slowed down searches on google as the program flooded the search site with queries looking for new e-mail addresses to send itself to.,tech
24,uk economy facing  major risks  the uk manufacturing sector will continue to face  serious challenges  over the next two years  the british chamber of commerce (bcc) has said.  the group s quarterly survey of companies found exports had picked up in the last three months of 2004 to their best levels in eight years. the rise came despite exchange rates being cited as a major concern. however  the bcc found the whole uk economy still faced  major risks  and warned that growth is set to slow. it recently forecast economic growth will slow from more than 3% in 2004 to a little below 2.5% in both 2005 and 2006.  manufacturers  domestic sales growth fell back slightly in the quarter  the survey of 5 196 firms found. employment in manufacturing also fell and job expectations were at their lowest level for a year.   despite some positive news for the export sector  there are worrying signs for manufacturing   the bcc said.  these results reinforce our concern over the sector s persistent inability to sustain recovery.  the outlook for the service sector was  uncertain  despite an increase in exports and orders over the quarter  the bcc noted.  the bcc found confidence increased in the quarter across both the manufacturing and service sectors although overall it failed to reach the levels at the start of 2004. the reduced threat of interest rate increases had contributed to improved confidence  it said. the bank of england raised interest rates five times between november 2003 and august last year. but rates have been kept on hold since then amid signs of falling consumer confidence and a slowdown in output.  the pressure on costs and margins  the relentless increase in regulations  and the threat of higher taxes remain serious problems   bcc director general david frost said.  while consumer spending is set to decelerate significantly over the next 12-18 months  it is unlikely that investment and exports will rise sufficiently strongly to pick up the slack.,business
25,worldcom boss  left books alone  former worldcom boss bernie ebbers  who is accused of overseeing an $11bn (£5.8bn) fraud  never made accounting decisions  a witness has told jurors.  david myers made the comments under questioning by defence lawyers who have been arguing that mr ebbers was not responsible for worldcom s problems. the phone company collapsed in 2002 and prosecutors claim that losses were hidden to protect the firm s shares. mr myers has already pleaded guilty to fraud and is assisting prosecutors.  on monday  defence lawyer reid weingarten tried to distance his client from the allegations. during cross examination  he asked mr myers if he ever knew mr ebbers  make an accounting decision  .  not that i am aware of   mr myers replied.  did you ever know mr ebbers to make an accounting entry into worldcom books   mr weingarten pressed.  no   replied the witness. mr myers has admitted that he ordered false accounting entries at the request of former worldcom chief financial officer scott sullivan. defence lawyers have been trying to paint mr sullivan  who has admitted fraud and will testify later in the trial  as the mastermind behind worldcom s accounting house of cards.  mr ebbers  team  meanwhile  are looking to portray him as an affable boss  who by his own admission is more pe graduate than economist. whatever his abilities  mr ebbers transformed worldcom from a relative unknown into a $160bn telecoms giant and investor darling of the late 1990s. worldcom s problems mounted  however  as competition increased and the telecoms boom petered out. when the firm finally collapsed  shareholders lost about $180bn and 20 000 workers lost their jobs. mr ebbers  trial is expected to last two months and if found guilty the former ceo faces a substantial jail sentence. he has firmly declared his innocence.,business
26,voters  don t trust politicians  eight out of 10 voters do not trust politicians to tell the truth  a new poll conducted for the bbc suggests.  and 87% of the 1 000 adults quizzed by icm for bbc news 24 said politicians did not deliver what they promised. the poll comes after foreign secretary jack straw predicted trust would be  the key choice  at the next election. both the tories and the lib dems are keen to emphasise a perceived lack of trust in tony blair  following his claims over iraqi weapons.  but according to the bbc poll  61% said the issue of trust made no difference to whether or not they would vote at the next election  widely expected on 5 may. the poll also looked at what lay behind the lack of trust in politicians. some 87% said politicians did not keep the promises they made before elections  while 92% said they never gave  a straight answer . just under three-quarters of respondents (73%) said politicians had shown themselves to be dishonest too often.  mr straw told activists in blackburn on thursday that voters would have to decide at the next election which party  best deserves  their  future trust .  that in the end is the key choice at the next election.   he acknowledged that the public had lost faith in labour  but suggested it could persuade people to  reinvest their trust with us  if the party could overcome tory attempts to spread cynicism in politics. the conservatives are keen to highlight the trust issue. during his response to gordon brown s budget statement on tuesday  michael howard compared the chancellor s figures to the prime minister s claims about iraq s weapons of mass destruction.  the lib dems are also keen to highlight the trust issue  with charles kennedy has claiming voters had a  fundamental lack of trust in the prime minister . and the green party unveiled a billboard opposite the palace of westminster accusing the government of lying over the iraq war.  former education secretary estelle morris told bbc news 24 that there was a  real problem of trust  between the public and the politicians. she said she did not feel her own colleagues could be trusted  but suggested the  three-cornered relationship  between the press  politicians and the public had a hand in the issue. the public was often turned off by sitting on the sidelines in  the battle of words  between the politician and the journalist  she added. lib dem foreign affairs spokesman menzies campbell said the iraq war had hit trust in politicians hard.  issues of war and peace  life and death do have a very damaging effect on the credibility of politicians . martin bell  who won the tatton seat from tory neil hamilton on anti-corruption platform  said politicians often failed to see themselves as others did.  we need public figures we trust to tell the truth and who can see themselves as others see them.,politics

30,france set for new da vinci novel french booksellers are braced for a rush of interest after another book from the author of the da vinci code is translated into french.  angels and demons  by us author dan brown  will go on sale on wednesday. the da vinci code is set in paris - including the louvre - and has sold around one million copies in france. the main character  robert langdon  also appears in angels and demons. the da vinci code is being made into a film starring tom hanks. angels and demons was written before the da vinci code  which has sold more than 20 million copies worldwide  and been translated into more than 40 languages  since it was released in 2003. angels and demons is set mainly in rome as symbologist robert langdon follows a 400-year-old trail to try to uncover a plot by an ancient brotherhood  the illuminati  to blow up the vatican.  the novel deals with moral issues such as the debate between science and religion and also seeks to uncover some of the mysteries surrounding the pope. on his website  brown wrote:  i think the reason angels and demons is raising eyebrows right now is that it opens some vatican closets most people don t even know exist.  but i think most people understand that an organisation as old and powerful as the vatican could not possibly have risen to power without acquiring a few skeletons in their closets.  such is the success of the da vinci code in france  special tours have been organised to trace langdon s footsteps  including the the louvre museum and the saint sulpice church. the louvre has also given permission for parts of the film version to be shot in the museum. the film  to be directed by a beautiful mind s ron howard  is due to start filming at the paris museum in may and stars hanks alongside french actress audrey tautou.,entertainment
31,all black magic: new zealand rugby playing colours:  all black  the haka and more!  the all blacks  charles john munro discovered rugby at london s christ college  and on his return to nelson he staged new zealand s first game. nelson town met nelson college on 14 may  1870  the town triumphing by two goals to nil  instigating a game that would become a national obsession and come to dominate the country s sporting passions. the game appealed to the kiwi psyche and quickly spread  the native maoris finding a particular empathy with the sport s warrior ethos. in 1888 a british team led by ae stoddart toured new zealand and australia  and soon after a maori named joe warbrick and an english ex-pat called thomas eyton decided to gather a combined new zealand team.  twenty-two maori and four  pakiha  formed the  new zealand native team   who played a total of 107 matches in new zealand  australia and the uk. the integration of white and maori was a reflecion of enlightened new zealand rugby and society  even if the british press were somewhat mystified by the pre-match tradition of the maori war dance  the haka! the other great symbol of new zealand rugby  the all black kit with the silver fern on the breast  was proposed by tom ellison at the first annual meeting of the new zealand rugby football union in 1893. new zealand played their first international against australia in 1903  the kiwis triumphing 22-3 in sydney  and the following year an official british touring team came to new zealand for the first time. the tourists had gone through australia undefeated but their captain  david revell bedell-sivright  created animosity in new zealand with his patronising attitude. the kiwis shocked the rugby world with a 9-3 triumph in wellington  sparking great celebrations across the country  but bedell-sivright churlishly suggested that the victors would have no chance when they visited the uk.  their opportunity to prove him wrong came in 1905 with the first official new zealand tour to europe. the tourists won their early games with a quick-thinking  inventive approach  but press criticism began to grow over their 2-3-2 scrum formation that left a  roving  forward free to disrupt opposition attacks. the tactic was effective  two late tries seeing the kiwis to a 12-7 win over scotland  before ireland were despatched 15-0 in dublin. a huge crowd at crystal palace convulsed with laughter at the sight of the haka - but the smiles were soon wiped from their faces when the tourists ran in five tries in a 15-0 hammering of england. new zealand headed to wales to meet a country in the midst of its first  golden age   and the encounter would be the first in a series of controversial clashes between the sides. an excellent try on the left wing by teddy morgan sealed a 3-0 win in a hard-fought encounter at cardiff arms park  but post-match talk was dominated by a bob deans try that was ruled out by scottish referee john dallas. dallas said that deans was tackled short  but the kiwi said he was dragged back into the field of play after grounding a try - on his death-bed three years later he exclaimed:  i did score that try in cardiff.   four of the 1905 all blacks went over to the newly formed  all golds  rugby league side soon after the tour  but new zealand were strong enough to crush an anglo-welsh touring team in 1908. the first south africa tour of new zealand in 1921 saw honours shared in a three-test series  starting the greatest rivalry in rugby - and the long-running controversy between the countries over the all blacks  inclusion of maori players. the awesome 1924-5 all black tourists became known as  the invincibles  after winning all 30 of their games in france  britain and ireland  including a crushing 19-0 victory over wales at st helen s. despite their success  the all blacks  2-3-2 scrum formation left them somewhat short of possession at times  and the flaws were exploited by the springboks in south africa in 1928. employing the modern 3-4-1 scrum line-up against the new zealand  rover  system for the first time  south african teams defeated the all blacks in five games and the test series was drawn two-all. the controversial new zealand scrum method finally disappeared after the 1930 lions tour (a series won 3-1 by new zealand)  the lions manager describing the tactic as  cheating   prompting the international rugby board to rule that three men had to pack down in the front row of the scrum.  the all blacks  1935 european tour started inauspiciously with an 11-3 loss to a swansea side inspired by teenage  schoolboy half-backs hayden tanner and willie davies. a thrilling test at cardiff arms park went to wales 13-12  although the winning try from geoffrey rees-jones was controversial following an illegal claude davey tackle in the build-up. new zealand s next visit to wales in 1953 proved difficult as they lost 8-3 to cardiff and drew 6-6 at swansea. the all blacks were on top in the test with wales at the arms park  but the teams were locked at 8-8 when a clem thomas cross kick was gathered by ken jones for a famous  match-winning try. the tourists made some amends with wins over the other home nations  before a 19-5 success over the barbarians in an arms park thriller. new zealand built from that tour  and by the time they returned in 1963-4 they were undoubtedly the leading side in the world.  that made the shock all the greater when a drop goal by student john uzzell gave newport an unlikely 3-0 win over the tourists at rodney parade. wilson whinneray s side rallied to beat wales 6-0  their first win at the arms park in four attempts  and went unbeaten through the rest of the tour  but when they returned home the first question put to them was:  what happened in newport   the only blemish on the record of the awesome 1967 tourists was a draw with east wales  as they beat the full wales team 13-6 in cardiff to take the lead in the series between the countries for the first time. that lead was increased with two comfortable wins for the home side in new zealand in 1969  the first time wales had toured the country as an independent team.  a ferocious game at the arms park in 1972 was edged 19-16 by the all blacks  a measure of revenge for the defeat inflicted on new zealand by the carwyn james-inspired lions of 1971.  james guided llanelli to a famous 9-3 win over the tourists at stradey park  though  and in the final game of the tour the barbarians defeated the all blacks 23-11 in cardiff in a game regarded by many as the greatest ever played. new zealand defeated a wales xv 12-3 at the arms park in a non-cap game in 1974  but it was the 1978 game in cardiff that would reignite the history of controversy between the two countries.  wales were leading 12-10 with one minute left when andy haden flew to the floor from a line-out. television pictures clearly showed that he dived  but english referee roger quittenton was fooled and awarded a penalty  duly converted by brian mckechnie for a 13-12 win. since that infamous game  the competition has largely left wales v new zealand fixtures as the men in red have slipped from the pinnacle of the world game. a crushing 23-3 win for new zealand in cardiff in the welsh rugby union s 1980 centenary game was a sign of things to come. the new professionalism in the southern hemisphere game that had left europe behind was shown as the all blacks swatted wales aside 49-6 in brisbane in the semi-final of the inaugural world cup. the kiwis went on to claim the cup  and would inflict further misery on wales on their ill-fated 1988 tour of new zealand.  a young  talented wales side left britain full of confidence as triple crown winners  but one of the greatest ever new zealand teams demolished them 52-3 and 54-9. after also taking some fearful beatings in the provincial games  wales captain jonathan davies returned home calling for urgent change in the national game  but as his views were ignored he - along with a generation of wales  best players - chose to head north to rugby league.  a 34-9 win in cardiff followed for new zealand in 1989  and at the 1995 world cup wales  big talk was made to look embarrassing as the all blacks eased to victory in johannesburg. a crushing 42-7 kiwi triumph in wembley followed in 1997  and as wales  misery increased they turned to new zealand for their salvation in the shape of coaches graham henry and steve hansen. there was a temporary resurgence in the welsh game  but when an experimental new zealand side came to cardiff s new millennium stadium in 2002 they left with a 43-17 victory.  a bruising 55-3 defeat followed for wales in hamilton in 2003 as hansen built towards the world cup  but in australia it was a remarkable performance against the all blacks that gave his side renewed hope. wales were given no chance going into the game  but in the course of the match they rediscovered the value of attacking flair to lead 37-33 early in the second half. new zealand rallied to a 53-37 win  but the style shown by wales has been used as an inspiration as they look to a better future. they now face an all blacks team led by henry and hansen  coming to europe with a weakened squad at the end of a long season. an encouraging display against south africa has inspired a confident wales camp to believe they can claim their first win over the men in black for over 50 years. they have a chance  but clearly history is not on their side.,sport
32,chris evans back on the market broadcaster chris evans has begun selling thousands of his possessions from a stall in camden market  london.  evans perched on a stool as shoppers wandered around the open-fronted shop packed with his furniture. among the items from his homes in los angeles and london were countless sofas  chairs  pictures  beds and memorabilia from his past tv shows. asked the reason for the sale  evans said:  i just want to get rid of it all  it s just a headache.  he added:  it feels good to be selling this stuff  it s a weight off my mind.  look at it all  there s so much clutter. i ve enjoyed every bit of furniture and every poster but it s not important anymore.  the normally gregarious evans cut a peculiarly unshowbusiness-like figure as he sipped coffee and smoked cigarettes  wrapped in a big coat and scarf in front of his aladdin s cave.  however  the ostentation of some of the items on sale painted a picture of the eccentricity that endeared him to the british public in shows such as channel 4 s gameshow don t forget your toothbrush. the most striking thing about many of the pieces was their sheer size. sofas looked like they could seat a small party and a bed seemed big enough for four. the elaborate nature of the pieces  many custom-made  had to be admired  particularly a huge red and gold upholstered  throne  and a stripy deckchair from the queen mary liner.  to help people in their browsing  evans had given the pieces labels with not only the price but a helpful  often comic  aside.  isn t it great  was the comment on the £1 950 throne and  bob dylan s old sofa - honest  was written on a dark wood couch priced £4 250.  the prices were steep by a lot of people s standards but evans said it was not deterring shoppers.  i ve sold quite a lot already. everything here is on sale for less than i bought it for but it s not really about the money. it s about getting rid of it all. we ve all been bartering  that s what it s all about.  he added that he was not going to reveal what he was going to do with the money he was making. vintage tv and film posters also lined the walls  including a rare portrait of raquel welch and an original advertising print from the benny hill show. and  almost hidden at the back of the lock-up  were the two giant toothbrushes from his former channel 4 show  although these were not for sale.  despite the sheer curiosity value of the sale  there was a healthy trickle of interest from the public rather than the perhaps expected crowds. some wandered in just to browse  as they would any of the other stalls  not knowing that it belonged to evans.  paul burgess said:  i didn t realise. i thought it was just a load of junk. i should go back and have a better look.  but local resident francesca detakats came specially to the stall and left happy with her purchase of an original 1960s photograph of the who by david wedgburg. ms detakats said she was a collector and did not mind paying £350 for the print.  if you like something  you don t really count it like that   she said.  martin hellewell  who had also made a point of visiting evans  shop  said he thought it was a great idea.  why not  if you ve got stuff to get rid of it s a good place to do it   said mr hellewell. evans has taken out the stall with business partner pete winterbottom. they plan to open every day if possible  although evans did not know how often he would be there.  we ll stay definitely until christmas and then maybe a week after that   said evans.,entertainment
33,spears seeks aborted tour payment singer britney spears is suing eight insurance companies that have refused to reimburse her for cancelling her 2004 world tour.  the pop star cancelled her onyx hotel tour last june after suffering a knee injury during a video shoot. she is now seeking to be reimbursed for the tour s £5m ($9.3m) costs in a claim filed at new york state supreme court. seven london-based companies and an eighth paris firm have been given up to 30 days to respond to the complaint.  the 22-year-old star initially missed a number of shows on the 82-date tour after injuring her knee during a show in illinois last march. but she was rushed to hospital and needed surgery after a later incident while filming a video for her song outrageous  leading her to cancel the rest of the tour  including dates in china.  she obviously took a wrong step and blew out her knee   a jive spokeswoman said at the time.  it was an old dance injury.  the legal submission described spears as  one of the most recognised performers in her industry . the onyx hotel tour was cited as  a highly crafted production which included the well-known music and dancing of spears  supported by elaborate costumes  complex choreography as well as cutting-edge video production  lighting and other effects . in september spears married kevin federline  who had been a dancer on the aborted tour.,entertainment

35,soaring oil  hits world economy  the soaring cost of oil has hit global economic growth  although world s major economies should weather the storm of price rises  according to the oecd.  in its latest bi-annual report  the oecd cut its growth predictions for the world s main industrialised regions. us growth would reach 4.4% in 2004  but fall to 3.3% next year from a previous estimate of 3.7%  the oecd said. however  the paris-based economics think tank said it believed the global economy could still regain momentum.  forecasts for japanese growth were also scaled back to 4.0% from 4.4% this year and 2.1% from 2.8% in 2005. but the outlook was worst for the 12-member eurozone bloc  with already sluggish growth forecasts slipping to 1.8% from 2.0% this year and 1.9% from 2.4% in 2005  the oecd said. overall  the report forecast total growth of 3.6% in 2004 for the 30 member countries of the oecd  slipping to 2.9% next year before recovering to 3.1% in 2006.  there are nonetheless good reasons to believe that despite recent oil price turbulence the world economy will regain momentum in a not-too-distant future   said jean-philippe cotis  the oecd s chief economist. the price of crude is about 50% higher than it was at the start of 2004  but down on the record high of $55.67 set in late october.  a dip in oil prices and improving jobs prospects would improve consumer confidence and spending  the oecd said.  the oil shock is not enormous by historical standards - we have seen worse in the seventies. if the oil price does not rise any further  then we think the shock can be absorbed within the next few quarters   vincent koen  a senior economist with the oecd  told the bbc s world business report.  the recovery that was underway  and has been interrupted a bit by the oil shock this year  would then regain momentum in the course of 2005.  china s booming economy and a  spectacular comeback  in japan - albeit one that has faltered in recent months - would help world economic recovery  the oecd said.  supported by strong balance sheets and high profits  the recovery of business investment should continue in north america and start in earnest in europe   it added. however  the report warned:  it remains to be seen whether continental europe will play a strong supportive role through a marked upswing of final domestic demand.  the oecd highlighted current depressed household expenditure in germany and the eurozone s over-reliance on export-led growth.,business
36,firms pump billions into pensions employers have spent billions of pounds propping up their final salary pensions over the past year  research suggests.  a survey of 280 schemes by incomes data services  (ids) said employer contributions had increased from £5.5bn to £8.2bn a year  a rise of 49.7%. companies facing the biggest deficits had raised their pension contributions by 100% or more  ids said. many firms are struggling to keep this type of scheme open  because of rising costs and increased liabilities. a final salary scheme  also known as a defined benefit scheme  promises to pay a pension related to the salary the scheme member is earning when they retire.  the rising cost of maintaining such schemes has led many employers to replace final salary schemes with money purchase  or defined contribution  schemes. these are less risky for employers. under money purchase schemes  employees pay into a pension fund which is used to buy an annuity - a policy which pays out an income until death - on retirement.  ids said there were some schemes in good health.  but  in many cases  firms had been forced to top up funds to tackle  yawning deficits . the level of contributions paid by employers has increased gradually since the late 1990s. in 1998/99  for example  contributions rose by 4.7% and in 2002/03 by 8.6%. in contrast  between 1996 and 1998  some employers cut their contribution levels. helen sudell  editor of the ids pensions service  said the rise in contributions was  staggering  and the highest ever recorded by ids.  we have warned before that the widespread closure of final salary schemes to new entrants is just the beginning of a much bigger movement away from paternalistic provision   said ms sudell.  with figures like this there can be little doubt that many employers will have to reduce future benefits at some point for those staff still in these schemes.,business
37,eu aiming to fuel development aid european union finance ministers meet on thursday to discuss proposals  including a tax on jet fuel  to boost development aid for poorer nations.  the policy makers are to ask for a report into how more development money can be raised  the eu said. the world s richest countries have said they want to increase the amount of aid they give to 0.7% of their annual gross national income by 2015. airlines have reacted strongly against the proposed fuel levy.  profits have been under pressure in the airline industry  with low-cost firms driving down prices and demand dipping after the 11 september terrorist attacks and the outbreak of the killer sars virus.  things have picked up  but some european and us companies are teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. at present  the fuel used by airlines enjoys either a very low tax rate or is untaxed in eu member states.  of course we applaud humanitarian initiatives  but why target the airlines   said ulrich schulte-strathaus  secretary general of the association of european airlines.  our industry is in the midst of a fundamental crisis...only to be once again confronted with a measure designed to increase our costs   he continued.  the eu sought to allay the airlines  fears  stressing that thursday s meeting was only a first step and that other proposals were also under consideration. it added that any plan to levy taxes on jet fuel  should not hinder the competitiveness of the airlines and that they themselves will not be solely funding development . any tax would only be implemented after full consultation with the airlines  the eu said. there is thought to be widespread support for the plan - tabled by france and germany following the recent g7 meeting of the world s richest nations - from eu ministers. the issue of poverty in africa and south asia has forced itself to the top of the politicial agenda  with politicians and campaigners calling for more to be done. at their meeting in london  g7 finance ministers backed plans to write off up to 100% of the debts of some of the world s poorest countries.,business
38,news corp eyes video games market news corp  the media company controlled by australian billionaire rupert murdoch  is eyeing a move into the video games market.  according to the financial times  chief operating officer peter chernin said that news corp is  kicking the tyres of pretty much all video games companies . santa monica-based activison is said to be one firm on its takeover list. video games are  big business   the paper quoted mr chernin as saying. we  would like to get into it .  the success of products such as sony s playstation  microsoft s x-box and nintendo s game cube have boosted demand for video games. the days of arcade classics such as space invaders  pac-man and donkey kong are long gone. today  games often have budgets big enough for feature films and look to give gamers as real an experience as possible. and with their price tags reflecting the heavy investment by development companies  video games are proving almost as profitable as they are fun.  mr chernin  however  told the ft that news corp was finding it difficult to identify a suitable target.  we are struggling with the gap between companies like electronic arts (ea)  which comes with a high price tag  and the next tier of companies   he explained during a conference in phoenix  arizona.  these may be too focused on one or two product lines.  activision has a stock market capitalisation of about $2.95bn (£1.57bn)  compared to ea s $17.8bn. some of the games industry s main players have recently been looking to consolidate their position by making acquisitions. france s ubisoft  one of europe s biggest video game publishers  has been trying to remain independent since electronic arts announced plans to buy 19.9% of the firm. analysts have said that industry mergers are likely in the future.,business
39,blind student  hears in colour  a blind student has developed software that turns colours into musical notes so that he can read weather maps.  victor wong  a graduate student from hong kong studying at cornell university in new york state  had to read coloured maps of the upper atmosphere as part of his research. to study  space weather  mr wong needed to explore minute fluctuations in order to create mathematical models. a number of solutions were tried  including having a colleague describe the maps and attempting to print them in braille. mr wong eventually hit upon the idea of translating individual colours into music  and enlisted the help of a computer graphics specialist and another student to do the programming work.   the images have three dimensions and i had to find a way of reading them myself   mr wong told the bbc news website.  for the sake of my own study - and for the sake of blind scientists generally - i felt it would be good to develop software that could help us to read colour images.  he tried a prototype version of the software to explore a photograph of a parrot. in order to have an exact reference to the screen  a pen and tablet device is used. the software then assigns one of 88 piano notes to individually coloured pixels - ranging from blue at the lower end of this scale to red at the upper end. mr wong says the application is still very much in its infancy and is only useful for reading images that have been created digitally.  if i took a random picture and scanned it and then used my software to recognise it  it wouldn t work that well.   mr wong has been blind from the age of seven and he thinks that having a  colour memory  makes the software more useful than it would be to a scientist who had never had any vision.  as the notes increase in pitch i know the colour s getting redder and redder  and in my mind s eye a patch of red appears.  the colour to music software has not yet been made available commercially  and mr wong believes that several people would have to work together to make it viable. but he hopes that one day it can be developed to give blind people access to photographs and other images.,tech

61,how to make a greener computer the hi-tech industry is starting to get more environmentally aware. bill thompson thinks it s about time.  my first car ran on four star petrol and pumped vast quantities of lead into the atmosphere as i drove around cambridge. now you can t buy petrol with lead additives  and we re all better off as a result. chip giant intel recently began shipping computer circuit boards that are lead free too  reflecting a growing awareness on the part of the technology industry that products have to be designed and built in more environmentally friendly ways.  apart from reducing the use of toxic materials like arsenic  mercury  cadmium and other heavy metals in the products themselves  the manufacturing process is also being cleaned up  with fewer complex and potentially damaging organic chemicals used as solvents. and work is going into making power supplies that are more energy efficient  since current transformers are astonishingly wasteful as they charge our laptops  mobiles and music players.  one of the key aspects of the new approach is to design products that are easier to recycle. if you have got a phone or a computer with toxic chemicals or heavy metals in it then extracting them can be tricky and expensive. a well-designed electronic component is able to be recycled at low cost. this is going to be very important to hardware manufacturers in europe since from august the new waste electronic and electrical equipment directive will oblige them to accept returned products for recycling.  they will end up paying if they build things that are expensive or impossible to take apart and will find their profits hit  something which is likely to motivate them where appeals to the wider public interest might fall on deaf ears. it is  as they say  about time. we have a long and depressing history of developing new technologies with complete disregard for their potential impact on the environment  and waiting until there is a crisis looming before we try to redesign them to cause less damage. the car engine is a case in point: lead additives helped stop petrol vapour exploding too early in the cylinder  a phenomenon called  knocking   so they were simply used without any real thought for the fact that the lead would end up in the atmosphere. redesigning engines and making petrol slightly different was a lot more work  so it took decades before it was done. we re seeing the same thing in the technology industry and  as a result  there are billions of devices  from old mobile phones to antique handhelds  that will have to be recycled in years to come. if apple gets its way then a lot of people are going to be buying a new mac mini and throwing away their old pc  keeping the monitor and other peripherals.  even if apple does not get its way  four or five-year-old computers are not good enough to run modern programs and it s not unreasonable to replace them. but what do we do with the old ones   i ve just looked around my office and i find two monitors  an old 386 pc  two old handhelds  three ancient laptops  four antique mobile phones  a collection of rechargeable batteries and even a sun workstation that is no longer really much use. they are all old enough to be hazardous waste - the monitors alone will be full of arsenic and lead - but it s possible that some of the components could be useful. i could take them up the to the council recycling centre  but it s a 10-mile drive away across town  and like many other people my commitment to recycling is shallow at best. here in cambridge we have green bins for compostable waste  a box for glass  cans and paper that can be recycled  and a black bin for the rest. there are bottle banks and clothing banks scattered around town and in supermarket car parks. would it be too much to ask for an electronics recycling box too  i d probably remember to take my old mobile with me to the supermarket and drop it in a box - at least eventually.  bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital.,tech

63,rank  set to sell off film unit  leisure group rank could unveil plans to demerge its film services unit and sell its media business  reports claim.  rank  formerly famous for the carry on series  will expose the shake-up at the announcement of its results on friday  the sunday telegraph reported. advisors goldman sachs are understood to have valued its demerged deluxe film unit at £300m  the report added. speculation of a possible shake-up has mounted since rank announced a study into a possible demerger in september. since mike smith s appointment as chief executive in 1999  the group has focused on fewer businesses and embarked on a major cost-cutting programme which has seen it dispose of a number of businesses  including the odeon cinema chain and the pinewood studios. the move left the group with three core divisions: gaming  hard rock and deluxe films  which provides technical services to hollywood studios.  rank now aims to concentrate on its gaming  bars and hotels business  including extending its hard rock brand to its casinos - trials of which have been a success. it also owns deluxe media  which makes and distributes dvds and videos. however  that business is seen as less successful. last year it made profits of £21.5m on a turnover of £392.1m and experts suggest its success in moving to dvds from vhs video could make it an attractive target for a private equity buyer. a spokesman for the firm refused to comment on the reports  but said any results from the demerger study were likely to be set out when it unveiled its results on friday. analysts predict the firm is likely to report a slight drop in annual pre-tax profits to £170m from £194m last year. formed in the 1940s the firm was a leading uk film producer and cinema owner for many years. it has now diversified into a range of other leisure activities - mainly in the uk - including hotels  roadside service areas and holiday centres. it now owns 34 grosvenor casinos  the mecca bingo chain and more than 100 hard rock cafes in 38 countries.,business

65,domain system scam fear a system to make it easier to create website addresses using alphabets like cyrillic could open a back door for scammers  a trade body has warned.  the internationalised domain names system has been a work in progress for years and has recently been approved by the internet electronic task force. but the uk internet forum (ukif) is concerned that the system will let scammers create fake sites more easily. the problem lies in the computer codes used to represent language.  registering names that look like that of legitimate companies but lead users to fake sites designed to steal passwords and credit card details could become a whole lot easier for determined scammers  says stephen dyer  director of ukif. domain names are the  real language  addresses of websites  rather than their internet protocol address  which is a series of numbers. they are used so people can more easily navigate the web. so-called ascii codes are used to represent european languages but for other languages a hybrid of a system called unicode is used. so  for example  website paypal could now be coded using a mixture of the latin alphabet and the russian alphabet. the resulting domain as displayed to the users would look identical to the real site as a russian  a  look just like an english  a . but the computer code would be different  and the site it would lead users to could be a fake. this is more than just a theory. a fake paypal.com has already been registered with net domain giant verisign by someone who has followed the debate around the internationalised domain name (idn) system  said mr dyer. as the idea was to prove a point rather than be malicious the fake domain has now been handed back to paypal but it sets a worrying precedent  mr dyer said.  although the idn problem is well known in technical circles  the commercial world is totally unaware how easily their websites can be faked   said mr dyer.   it is important to alert users that there is a new and invisible and almost undetectable way of diverting them to what looks like a perfectly genuine site   he added. there are solutions. for instance  browsers could spot domains that use mixed characters and display them in different colours as a warning to users. mr dyer acknowledged that it would be a huge undertaking to update all the world s browsers. another solution  to introduce idn-disabled browsers could be a case of  throwing out the baby with the bath water   he said. centr  the council of european national top level domain registries  agrees.  a rush to introduce idn-disabled browsers into the marketplace is an overly-zealous step that will harm public confidence in idns - a technology that is desperately needed in the non-english speaking world   the organisation said in a statement.,tech

73,satellite mapping aids darfur relief aid workers trying to house  feed and clothe millions of homeless refugees in the sudanese region of darfur are getting a helping hand from advanced mapping technology.  a european consortium of companies and university groups known as respond is working to provide accurate and up to date maps. the aim is to overcome some of the huge logistical challenges in getting supplies to where they are needed. respond is using satellite imagery to produce accurate maps that can be used in the field rapidly.  respond has produced very detailed maps for example for the road networks  for the rivers and for the villages  to more large-scale maps useful for very general planning purposes   said einar bjorgo from unosat  the un satellite mapping organisation that is part of the respond consortium.  the group uses satellites from nasa  the european space agency and the disaster monitoring constellation. the satellite data is transmitted to ground stations. from there  the information makes its way to respond organisations that specialise in interpreting such data.  you have to convert the data into images  then the interpreter has to convert all this into crisis  damage  or situation maps   said stefan voigt  who works in the remote sensing department of one of those organisations  the german aerospace centre.  this kind of detailed analysis usually takes a couple of months but respond gets it done in about 12 hours.  our users are usually not so much familiar with reading satellite imagery  reading satellite maps  so it s our task to transfer the data into information that non-technical people can read and understand easily and very  very efficiently   said mr voigt. respond supplies maps to aid groups via the web  and on compact disc. but the best map is one you can hold in your hands  especially in remote areas where internet connections and laptops are scarce.  a map is a working document   explains herbert hansen of respond s belgian partner keyobs.  you need to use it  you need to write on it  correct  give feedback and so on  so you need paper to write on.  we print maps  we laminate the maps  we encapsulate the maps if needed so you can take a shower with the map  it s completely protected.   humanitarian groups in darfur have been making good use of respond s maps. they have come in especially handy during sudan s rainy season  when normally dry riverbeds  or wadis  became flooded.  these wadis had a very small amount of flooding  generally  in terms of depth  but greatly impeded the transport capabilities and capacities of the humanitarian groups on the ground   says stephen candillon of respond imaging partner sertit. respond s rapid imaging has allowed aid groups to find ways around the wadis  allowing then to mark on their maps which roads were washed out at which times. aid groups say that combination of satellite technology and on-the-ground observation helped keep relief flowing to those who needed it.  clark boyd is technology correspondent for the world  a bbc world service and wgbh-boston co-production,tech

75,howard pitches for uk ethnic vote michael howard is to make a pitch for britain s ethnic vote urging people who feel  taken for granted  by tony blair to vote conservative.  he will say conservatives  share the same values  as the uk s minorities. and that he wants to build a  better britain  where everyone  whatever the colour of their skin or religion  can  make the most of their talents . but the tory leader will argue against positive discrimination saying it is  outdated and unjust .   it sets family against family and it leads ethnic communities to doubt their own abilities   he will argue. mr howard - himself the son of immigrants - will acknowledge that racial discrimination still exists in the uk.  people from ethnic communities  for example  still earn less than their white counterparts   he will say before arguing the answer to helping everyone to get on was  free enterprise  free trade  free speech . the tory leader will also call for religious tolerance arguing that hindus and sikhs as well as muslims got  caught in the downdraft of islamaphobia which was one of the terrible side effects of 9/11 .  mr howard will make his speech during a visit to support tory parliamentary hopefuls robert light and sayeeda warsi -  the first british muslim woman  selected to run for mp as a conservative candidate. he will attack labour s record in government over issues such as tax and he will set out tory plans for an immigration quota to be set by mps. mr howard will also attack the lib dems for wanting to abolish faith schools  introduce compulsory sex education from the age of seven  and  give contraceptives out in schools from the age of 11 .  so i say to all those people from ethnic minorities who feel mr blair and the liberal democrats take their votes for granted - come join us   he will say. lib dem president simon hughes branded mr howard  arrogant and wrong  for claiming the tories were the  natural party  for britain s ethnic minorities.  given the tories  considerably reduced support in urban areas  where many black and asian britons live  during their time in power  the evidence simply does not support his claims that the conservatives are the party for these communities   he said.,politics
76,lib dems unveil women s manifesto the liberal democrats are attempting to woo female voters with the launch of their manifesto for women.  charles kennedy is pledging a maternity income guarantee and a pension system based on years of residence rather than national insurance payments. he also thinks women will back plans to end university tuition fees and for free long-term care for the elderly. both labour and the conservatives have said they also plan to boost pensions and to improve childcare support. mr kennedy says he wants to deal with policy areas that disadvantage women.  two million pensioners in britain currently live below the government s own poverty line - two-thirds of whom are women   he said.  he says that pensions based on the number of years worked ignore the contribution women make caring for children. the lib dem s citizen s pension  based on length of residency not on national insurance contributions  would address that imbalance  mr kennedy argues. under the package  new mothers would be offered minimum guaranteed maternity pay of £170 a week for the first six months after the birth of their first child. mr kennedy also believes the party s plans to use the money saved from not introducing  illiberal  id cards to boost police numbers by 10 000 would appeal to women too. the policies are not new announcements  but the way they are structured as a package to appeal to women is.  mr kennedy also points to the fact that 40% of the party s candidates set to stand in winnable or target seats are women. party strategists claim that where women candidates replace men turnout rises by 4%. mr kennedy began the pitch for female support with an interview on bbc radio 4 s women s hour on monday. during the interview mr kennedy revealed that he planned to structure the party s general election campaign around the birth of his first child  which is expected in april. the baby and his wife sarah would be  priority number one  even if it arrived in the middle of the election campaign  he said.  party strategists believe winning over a significant proportion of women voters is key to electoral success. a party spokesman said it was courting female votes because they tended to vote more than men and are believed to be more considered and open-minded in deciding who they vote for. labour s deputy minister for women jacqui smith accused the lib dems of offering  false promises  to women and said their sums did not add up. she said:  these proposals would increase the costs to the public purse drastically year on year  and hard working families will pay dearly  through either increased taxes or reduced spending on public services . the labour party has committed itself to  universal  affordable and flexible  childcare for parents of all 3 to 14 year-olds  including childcare centred on schools to be available from 8am to 6pm. in september  trade and industry secretary patricia hewitt said she would like to see longer paid maternity leave  higher paternity pay and the extension of flexible working rights to carers  if labour won a third term. the conservatives are yet to unveil their manifesto plans for childcare but said in november they would increase maternity pay and pay the child tax credit in cash to parents to spend as they like  on a nanny  au pair or even a family member  such as a grandparent  acting as a carer. they were also consulting on making childcare costs tax deductible.,politics
77,labour faces  cold calls  inquiry labour is to be investigated by a watchdog over claims its election campaign has broken the rules on  cold calling  householders.  the information commissioner is to look into a complaint from the lib dems about how labour uses its call centres. the lib dems say labour is telephoning people who have signed up to make sure they do not get marketing calls. labour denies breaking rules. it says calls are not marketing if they just ask about people s voting intentions. the party says it would expect the watchdog to take complaints seriously but it has clear legal advice on the issue.  telephone call centres are expected to be used as never before by all the three major parties in the run-up to the general election. but seven million telephone numbers are on the telephone preference service (tps) lists  which ban unsolicited sales and marketing calls. lib dem chairman matthew taylor has written to the watchdog accusing labour of a  flagrant and systematic breach  of the laws governing the tps.  he says the initial call may not be marketing but it identifies voters to whom the party can send promotional material in the future. his letter to the commissioner quotes from a labour party handbook about  identifying target voters . and it quotes a stevenage labour party members  newsletter explaining how voters will be telephoned about their voting intentions.  the voters are put in 24 categories according to their last known voting intention  ranging from  labour (firm)  to  target (conservative)  - those who supported the party in the past but this time will be voting tory. the newsletter says:  using the information we know about people  we can send them direct mailings.  for example  we could send the target (conservative) people a letter from someone who had defected from the tories to labour explaining the reasons why voting tory is a bad idea or we could send labour (weak) people a letter encouraging them to sign up for a postal vote.   mr taylor tells the commissioner:  it is clear beyond peradventure from the above that the labour party is engaging in a large-scale voter id project for subsequent promotional purposes through targeted and segmented mailings.  insofar as this project is directed at tps subscribers  it is equally clear that it is unlawful.  the lib dems raised worries about labour and conservative calls in february and 680 people have signed up to the website they set up to help people to complain. a party official said there was only scattered evidence of the tories breaking the rules but people had complained every day about labour.  a spokeswoman for the information commissioner s office said it was examining one complaint about political calls - understood to be mr taylor s.  we are investigating one of the complaints where some evidence has been given to us   she said.  obviously evidence is needed for us to start investigations.  the commissioner s office will now examine the lib dem evidence.  the guidance is that cold calling can be made as long as no marketing is going on   said the spokeswoman. if labour is judged to have broken the rules  it will be asked stop immediately. if it fails to do so after two or three warning letters  the commissioner can issue an enforcement notice spelling out what the party needs to do or stop doing.  the party could appeal against the decision to an information tribunal. if the appeal fails and it continues breaking the rules  it could be fined up to £5 000. labour says it avoids those on tps lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising but not when making  voter identification  calls. asked about the commissioner s inquiry  a labour spokesman told bbc news:  we expect the information commissioner to take any complaint seriously. however  we are absolutely clear that we haven t broken any rules.  as the information commissioner himself has said  if people are not marketing something  if they are asking them which way they are going to vote  they are not in breach of the law.  we always ask everyone we phone up whether they would be happy to be contacted by the labour party again.,politics

80,eu software patent law faces axe the european parliament has thrown out a bill that would have allowed software to be patented.  politicians unanimously rejected the bill and now it must go through another round of consultation if it is to have a chance of becoming law. during consultation the software patents bill could be substantially re-drafted or even scrapped. the bill was backed by some hi-tech firms  saying they needed protections it offered to make research worthwhile.  hugo lueders  european director for public policy at comptia  an umbrella organization for technology companies  said only when intellectual property was adequately protected would european inventors prosper. he said the benefits of the bill had been obscured by special interest groups which muddied debate over the rights and wrongs of software patents. other proponents of the bill said it was a good compromise that avoided the excesses of the american system which allows the patenting of business practices as well as software. but opponents of the bill said that it could stifle innovation  be abused by firms keen to protect existing monopolies and could hamper the growth of the open source movement. the proposed law had a troubled passage through the european parliament. its progress was delayed twice when polish meps rejected plans to adopt it. also earlier this month the influential european legal affairs committee (juri) said the law should be re-drafted after it failed to win the support of meps. to become law both the european parliament and a qualified majority of eu states have to approve of the draft wording of the bill. the latest rejection means that now the bill on computer inventions must go back to the eu for re-consideration.,tech
81,how to make a gigapixel picture the largest digital panoramic photo in the world has been created by researchers in the netherlands.  the finished image is 2.5 billion pixels in size - making it about 500 times the resolution of images produced by good consumer digital cameras. the huge image of delft was created by stitching together 600 single snaps of the dutch city taken at a fixed spot. if printed out in standard 300 dots per inch resolution  the picture would be 2.5m high and 6m long.  the researchers have put the image on a website which lets viewers explore the wealth of detail that it captures. tools on the page let viewers zoom in on the city and its surroundings in great detail. the website is already proving popular and currently has more than 200 000 visitors every day.  the image was created by imaging experts from the dutch research and technology laboratory tno which created the 2.5 gigapixel photo as a summer time challenge.  the goal of the project was to be one of the first groups to make gigapixel images. the first image of such a size was manually constructed by us photographer max lyons in november 2003. that image portrayed bryce canyon national park  in utah  and was made up of 196 separate photographs. the panorama of delft is a little staid in contrast to the dramatic rockscape captured in mr lyons  image.  he did it all by hand  which was an enormous effort  and we got the idea that if you use automatic techniques  it would be feasible to build a larger image   said jurgen den hartog  one of the tno researchers behind the project.  we were not competing with mr lyons  but it started as a lunchtime bet.   the dutch team used already available technologies  although it had to upgrade them to be able to handle the high-resolution image.   we had to rewrite almost all the tools   me den hartog told the bbc news website.  all standard windows viewers available would not be able to load such a large image  so we had to develop one ourselves.  the 600 component pictures were taken on july 2004 by a computer-controlled camera with a 400 mm lens. each image was made to slightly overlap so they could be accurately arranged into a composite. the stitching process was also done automatically using five powerful pcs over three days. following the success of this project  and with promises of help from others  the tno team is considering creating a full 360-degree panoramic view of another dutch city  with even higher resolution.,tech

83,redford s vision of sundance despite sporting a corduroy cap pulled low over his face plus a pair of dark glasses  robert redford cuts an unmistakable figure through the star-struck crowds at sundance.  it s a rare downtown appearance for the man who started the annual festival in park city  utah back in the 1980s. now in its twenty-first year  sundance continues to grow. some 45 000 people are estimated to have descended on this small ski town with nothing but movies on the mind. it s an opportunity to meet and make deals. redford wanted sundance to be a platform for independent film-makers  but the commercial success of many showcased films have led to criticism that the festival is becoming too mainstream.  smaller festivals like slamdance and xdance  which take place during the same week in park city  are competing for sundance s limelight. but redford is not worried.  the more the merrier   he says.  the point was to create opportunities for people who may not have them.  once independent film had a place where the work could be seen  suddenly the merchants came. with them the celebrities came  then the paparazzi - and suddenly it began to take on a whole new tone   explains redford.   people started to say we had gone mainstream and hollywood  but actually hollywood came to us because suddenly there was good business in independent film   he adds. international film-makers have always been celebrated here  but 2005 is the first year a dedicated world dramatic and documentary competition is being held.  redford wants the festival to encompass viewpoints he believes the american media fails to reflect  particularly how the us is perceived internationally. he has never hidden the fact that he is a democrat. but he reserves particular disdain for the current republican administration.  it s the ability to maintain the importance of dissent in a democratic system which right now is under threat with the attitude of this administration   he says.  i think many voices are being shut down or accused of being unpatriotic if they want to express another point of view. that s very unhealthy and very dangerous.   if we take that policy into the world  there will be the same victims and the same consequences.  sundance isn t just one big screening. there are discussion panels and q&a sessions with directors tackling controversial topics like america s  culture wars  and the iraq war. while redford wishes the festival to be a forum for dissent  the profile of the audience is fairly monolithic. educated  middle class and predominantly white americans comes sundance  with views from the same end of the political spectrum - anti-war and socially liberal. but redford knows this and started the sundance tv channel in an effort to reach a wider audience.  when you look at the films here  what we are presenting is very much egalitarian. and it s about good films and good story-telling be it african america  asian  women  gay  lesbian.  sooner or later we will do away with those stereotypical labels and people will say  it s just a film by so-and so .,entertainment

87,oil companies get russian setback international oil and mining companies have reacted cautiously to russia s decision to bar foreign firms from natural resource tenders in 2005.  us oil giant exxon said it did not plan to take part in a new tender on a project for which it had previously signed a preliminary agreement. miner highland gold said it regretted any limit on privatisation while bp  a big investor  declined to comment. only firms at least 51% russian-owned will be permitted to bid.  the federal natural resources agency said  the government is interested in letting russian companies develop strategic resources . the foreign ownership issue will be dealt with according to russia s competition law  natural resources minister yuri trutnev was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency. no further details were given  with mr trutnev suggesting that russia may decide on a case-by-case basis. observers said that the move may represent a shift in policy  as the administration of vladimir putin puts the protection of national interests above free market dynamics. russia recently wrested back control of a large chunk of its oil industry from stock-market listed company yukos  a move that prompted calls of outrage from many investors.  analysts warned that it was still too early to draw too many conclusions from this new set of proposals.  companies echoed this sentiment  saying that they would require more information before ringing the alarm bells.  it s not good. but it is very understandable   said al breach  an economist at ubs brunswick.  but if the investment climate is stable - that s much more important.  foreigners of course would like to have free entry but... this is not the end of the world.  a number of other nations  including mexico  saudi arabia and kuwait  protect their national resources from foreign firms. what has surprised observers is that since the collapse of communism russia has been courting foreign investment.  bp spent $7.5bn to create russian-registered oil company tnk-bp  and has a partnership to develop the sakhalin 5 petroleum field with state-owned rosneft. exxon  the world s largest oil company  has signed preliminary agreements to develop the sakhalin 3 field. company spokesman glenn waller said exxon still considered the deal valid  despite russia inviting new offers for the land block. according to mr waller  exxon  were not planning to bid at a new tender anyway .  we regret the ministry has taken such a decision   said ivan kulakov  deputy chairman of highland gold - a mining firm that has the motto  bringing russia s gold to market .  it would be a shame if that has a negative impact on the investment climate.  other firms that have been linked with investment in russia include france s total  the us-based chevrontexaco  and miner barrick gold.,business
88,business fears over sluggish eu economy as european leaders gather in rome on friday to sign the new eu constitution  many companies will be focusing on matters much closer to home - namely how to stay in business.  lille is a popular tourist destination for britons who want a taste of france at the weekend. but how many tourists look at the impressively grand victorian chambre de commerce  which stands beside the opera house  and consider that it was built - like the town halls in many northern english towns - on the wealth created by coal  steel and textiles  like northern england and industrial scotland  those industries have been in long term decline - the last coal pit closed in 1990. beck-crespel is a specialist steel firm in armentieres  about 20 miles from lille. the company has not laid off a worker since 1945. it specialises in making bolts and fixings for power stations and the oil industry  but not many of those are being built in europe these days.  director hugues charbonnier says he is under pressure because factories in the far east are able to make some of his output more cheaply  while his key markets are now in china and india.  in our business the market is absolutely global  you can not imagine living with our size (of business) even within an enlarged european union  (if we did that) we would need not 350 people but perhaps just 150 or 200   he says. it isn t just globalisation that is hurting; the law in france means workers are paid for a 39 hour week even though they work just 35 hours. but at least there is still a steel industry. coal has now totally vanished and textiles are struggling. new business has been attracted  but not enough to make up the difference.  that is one reason why people here are not great fans of the eu  says frederic sawicki  a politics lecturer at the university of lille.   in the region today the unemployment rate is 12%  in some areas it is 15%. they don t see what europe is doing for them  so there is a kind of euro scepticism  especially in the working classes   he says. which is strange because lille is at the crossroads of europe - if anywhere should be benefiting from the euro it is here. the euro was designed to increase trade within the eurozone  but the biggest increase in trade has been with the rest of the world. much of that trade passes through the world s largest port  rotterdam  in holland  home to specialist crane maker huisman itrec. its cranes help build oil rigs and lifted the sunken russian submarine kursk from the sea bed  but huisman itrec is now setting up a factory in china  where costs are cheaper and its main customers are closer.  boss henk addink blames the low growth rate in europe for the lack of orders closer to home.  in the us growth is something like 6%  in china they are estimating 15%  and in the eu it is more or less 1%   he says. mr addink blames the euro for stifling demand. he much preferred the old currencies of europe  which moved in relation to each country s economic performance. in germany  industry is exporting more these days  but the economy as a whole is once again mired in slow growth and high unemployment. growth is likely to peak this year at just under 2%. in britain that would be a bad year; in germany it is one of the best in recent years. with germany making up a third of the eurozone s economy  this is a major problem. if germany doesn t once again become the powerhouse of europe  growth across the bloc is never going to be as strong as it could be. however  at one factory near the dutch border things are changing.  the siemens plant at boscholt makes cordless phones and employs 2 000 staff. staff have started working an extra four hours a week for no extra pay  after siemens threatened to take the factory and their jobs to hungary. factory manager herbert stueker says that he now hopes to increase productivity  by nearly 30% . but germany needs much more reform if all its industry is to compete with places such hungary or china. the government is reforming the labour market and cutting the generous unemployment system  but the real solution is to cut the wages of low skilled workers  says helmut schneider  director of the institute for the study of labour at bonn university.  labour is too costly in germany  especially for the low skilled labour and this is the main problem. if we could solve that problem we could cut unemployment by half   he says. the eu set itself the target of being the most efficient economy in the world by 2010. four years into that process  and the target seems further away than ever.,business
89,cairn shares slump on oil setback shares in cairn energy  a uk oil firm  have closed down 18% after a disappointing drilling update and a warning over possible tax demands.  the company said tests had shown no significant finds in one of its indian oil fields  but was upbeat about the potential of other areas. it also said the indian government had told it to pay a production tax  for which cairn argues it is not liable. cairn s shares have jumped by almost 400% this year. investors had piled into cairn after the company announced significant oil finds in india this year. chief executive bill gammell said on friday he was  disappointed  with exploration in the so-called n-c extension area in rajasthan. investors had held high hopes of major oil finds in this area. but cairn said estimates had been revised in what was a  significant downgrade of the initial expectation .  cairn also said that the government believed the company was liable to pay taxes under its production-sharing contract. the company said the rate would be about 900 rupees ($20.40; £10.50) per tonne  or seven barrels  of oil. a spokesman for the firm said that the tax would wipe 5% of the field s current value.   cairn refutes the government s position   mr gammell said. he insisted that the contract made it clear that the tax should be shouldered by the licensee - india s state-run oil & natural gas corp (ongc) - and not the contractor.  we have a pretty strong legal case here   he added  saying it would only become an issue once the firm started production. investors took a dim view of the statements though. the shares closed down 247p  or 18%  at 1115 pence.  i think people were slightly over-ambitious for how quickly cairn would be able to develop and potentially offload these reserves   said analyst jason kenney at ing.  the disappointments overshadowed increased production targets for cairn s existing oilfields. the company raised targets for its mangala and aishwariya fields in india from 60 000 barrels a day to between 80 000 and 100 000 barrels a day. its mangala field  thought to contain a billion barrels  is its biggest find to date.  these two fields will provide the core of the future developments in rajasthan   mr gammell said. cairn added that it would be appraising another field early next year. mr gammell set up the company in the 1980s and has successfully switched its focus to south asia from interests in the us and europe. cairn  which also operates in nepal and bangladesh  was catapulted into the ftse 100 index of leading uk shares earlier this year after the sharp rise in its share price.,business
90,enron bosses in $168m payout eighteen former enron directors have agreed a $168m (£89m) settlement deal in a shareholder lawsuit over the collapse of the energy firm.  leading plaintiff  the university of california  announced the news  adding that 10 of the former directors will pay $13m from their own pockets. the settlement will be put to the courts for approval next week. enron went bankrupt in 2001 after it emerged it had hidden hundreds of millions of dollars in debt.  before its collapse  the firm was the seventh biggest public us company by revenue. its demise sent shockwaves through financial markets and dented investor confidence in corporate america.   the settlement is very significant in holding these outside directors at least partially personally responsible   william lerach  the lawyer leading the class action suit against enron  said.  hopefully  this will help send a message to corporate boardrooms of the importance of directors performing their legal duties   he added. under the terms of the $168m settlement - $155m of which will be covered by insurance - none of the 18 former directors will admit any wrongdoing. the deal is the fourth major settlement negotiated by lawyers who filed a class action on behalf of enron s shareholders almost three years ago. so far  including the latest deal  just under $500m (£378.8m) has been retrieved for investors.  however  the latest deal does not include former enron chief executives ken lay and jeff skilling. both men are facing criminal charges for their alleged misconduct in the run up to the firm s collapse. neither does it cover andrew fastow  who has pleaded guilty to taking part in an illegal conspiracy while he was chief financial officer at the group. enron s shareholders are still seeking damages from a long list of other big name defendants including the financial institutions jp morgan chase  citigroup  merrill lynch and credit suisse first boston. the university of california said the trial in the case is scheduled to begin in october 2006. it joined the lawsuit in december 2001alleging  massive insider trading  and fraud  claiming it had lost $145m on its investments in the company.,business
91,indonesia  declines debt freeze  indonesia no longer needs the debt freeze offered by the paris club group of creditors  economics minister aburizal bakrie has reportedly said.  indonesia  which originally accepted the debt moratorium offer  owes the paris club about $48bn (£25.5bn). mr bakrie told the bisnis indonesia newspaper that a $1.7bn donors  aid package meant that the debt moratorium was unnecessary. this aid comes on top of a previously-pledged $3.4bn package. most of this  normal aid  would be used to finance the country s budget deficit. the indonesian economics minister explained that the money - $1.2bn in grants and $500m in soft loans - was for the rebuilding of aceh province  which was badly hit by the tsunami of 26 december. nevertheless  one of mr bakrie s deputies  mahendra siregar  told afp news agency that indonesia was still considering the offer by the paris club of rich creditor nations to temporarily suspend its debt payments.  what is true is that we are still discussing... the paris club decision to find out more details such as how much of our debt will be subject to a moratorium. that s how far we are at this stage   said mr siregar.  the 19 member countries of the paris club are owed about $5bn this year in debt repayments by nations affected by the indian ocean tsunami. indonesia  sri lanka and the seychelles accepted the paris club offer  which was criticised by some aid groups as being too little. thailand and india have however declined the offer  with thailand prefering to keep up with its payments while india said it would prefer to rely on its own resources rather than on international aid. putting off payments may lower a country s rating among financial organisations  making it more expensive and more difficult for them to borrow money in the future  analysts said. separately  the indonesian government has said it will announce monthly how much it has received in foreign donations and how it has spent the money. welfare minister alwi shihab told ap news agency that this announcement should allay suspicion of official corruption in relief operations.,business

94,pm apology over jailings tony blair has apologised to two families who suffered one of the uk s biggest miscarriages of justice.  the prime minister was commenting on the wrongful jailing of 11 people for ira bomb attacks on pubs in guildford and woolwich in 1974. mr blair said:  i am very sorry that they were subject to such an ordeal and injustice.  he made the apology to members of the conlon and maguire families in his private room at westminster. in a statement recorded for television  mr blair said the families deserved  to be completely and publicly exonerated .  the families had hoped the apology would be made during prime minister s questions in the house of commons. however  one of the so-called guildford four  gerry conlon - who was wrongly convicted of planting the bombs - said the families were delighted with the apology. he said mr blair had spoken with  such sincerity   adding:  he went beyond what we thought he would  he took time to listen to everyone.  you could see he was moved by what people were saying.  tony blair has healed rifts  he is helping to heal wounds. it s a day i never thought would come.  the move followed a huge campaign in ireland for a public apology after eleven people were wrongly convicted of making and planting the ira bombs which killed seven people. mr blair s official spokesman said no-one present at the meeting would  ever forget the strength of feeling of relief that the prime minister s statement brought to them .  most of those convicted were either members or friends of the two families. all were arrested because of a family connection to gerry conlon. mr conlon s father giuseppe was arrested when travelling to london from belfast to help his son. he died while serving his sentence. also arrested were anne maguire and members of her family. mrs maguire was the relative with whom giuseppe planned to stay in london  as well as two family friends. she said it was a  wonderful feeling  to have had the apology and that a weight had been lifted off her shoulders.   the people who were still doubting us should now believe that we were totally innocent   she said. they were all jailed for handling explosives  based on scientific evidence which was later entirely discredited. in october 1989 the court of appeal quashed the sentences of the guildford four  and in june 1991 it overturned the sentences on the maguire seven. mr conlon s case was highlighted in the oscar-nominated film in the name of the father  starring daniel day-lewis.,politics

103,clyde 0-5 celtic celtic brushed aside clyde to secure their place in the scottish cup semi-final  but only after a nervy and testing first half.  the home side s craig bryson had a goal chopped off before stan varga headed celtic into the lead. alan thompson scored from the penalty spot at the start of the second half after shaun maloney had been fouled. stilian petrov slid in a third  varga tapped in his second and craig bellamy completed the rout with a fine drive. bryn halliwell was the busier keeper early on  saving from bellamy  chris sutton and juninho. clyde had the ball in the net after half-an-hour through a tremendous strike from bryson  but the referee had already blown for a foul by petrov. from the resulting free kick  darren sheridan curled the ball round the celtic wall only for the post to deny him. back at the other end  halliwell did well to come off his line and block bellamy s effort to lift the ball over him. the keeper misjudged a corner that stephane henchoz headed wide  but a similar scenario five minutes before the break led to the opening goal. the ball was delivered from the left and halliwell was left floundering as varga glanced the ball into the net.  maloney replaced the injured sutton at half time and he marked his first competitive appearance after a year out injured by helping his side take a two-goal lead just after the break. the young striker fired a free kick straight into the clyde wall but as he collected the rebound  he was tripped by bryson and thompson converted the penalty. sheridan and bellamy were involved in something of a flare-up that led to both being booked after the intervention of the assistant referee. juninho brought out another good save from halliwell and then petrov saw a tremendous effort come off the top of the bar. but petrov and juninho combined brilliantly to allow the bulgarian to make it 3-0 on the hour mark - a quick one-two giving him the time and space to steer the ball past halliwell from 12 yards. varga got his second goal of the game as celtic drove home their advantage - thompson whipped in a corner from the right and the unmarked defender simply tapped the ball over the line from a couple of yards out. celtic were utterly dominant by this stage and bellamy opened his scoring account for the club after a fine move involving aiden mcgeady  jackie mcnamara and maloney culminated in the welshman hammering the ball into the net. halliwell kept the deficit at five by pushing a mcgeady shot wide as the game petered out.  halliwell  mensing  bollan  balmer  potter  sheridan (burns 61)  arbuckle (gilhaney 61)  gibson  bryson (jones 78)  malone  harty.  morrison  wilson.  mensing  sheridan.  douglas  henchoz  mcnamara  balde  varga  juninho paulista  thompson  lennon (lambert 70)  sutton (maloney 45)  petrov (mcgeady 70)  bellamy.  marshall  laursen.  thompson  bellamy.  : varga 40  thompson 48 pen  petrov 60  varga 68  bellamy 72.  8 200  c thomson,sport
104,howard attacks  pay later  budget tory leader michael howard has dismissed gordon brown s budget as  vote now  pay later  spending plans.  the simple fact was that under a new labour government taxes would go up after the election to plug a financial black hole  mr howard said. everyone could see the chancellor s  sweeteners   but these hid tax rises for hard working families  he said. labour s  faltering election campaign  would not be helped by the package of measures  mr howard added.  mr brown s budget was not about what was good for the country  but  all about the interests of the labour party   the tory leader said after mockingly welcoming the chancellor back to the election campaign. he went on to accuse mr brown of giving with one hand while taking away with the other. he urged the chancellor to admit he had been responsible for dragging  millions of people in to the net  to pay stamp duty and inheritance tax.  we can all see the sweeteners  but they hide the crippling tax rises for hard-working families that are inevitable if labour wins.   he also accused the government and the chancellor of running out of solutions to the problems britain faced.  their only answer is to tax  to spend and to waste - to get people to vote now and pay later.  mr brown liked to rattle off  magical balances conjured out of thin air  in a bid to convince people there was no  black hole  in the nation s finances  the tory leader said.  this dodgy government that brought us the dodgy dossier is now publishing a dodgy budget based on dodgy numbers   he said.  you now propose to borrow  over the next six years  no less than £168 billion; so much for prudence.  the chancellor s forecasts of surpluses are no better than the prime minister s forecasts of weapons of mass destruction.   mr brown s council tax rebate for pensioners was £300 less than what the tories were offering  mr howard said. there was nothing in the budget that would put more police on the streets  make hospitals cleaner or give parents and teachers the discipline and skills they wanted in schools. people would face a  clear choice  at the election  either  more waste and higher taxes under labour or lower taxes and value for money with the conservatives   he said.  that s the battleground of this election. that s what this election is going to be all about and i say bring it on   he concluded  to loud tory cheering.,politics
105,euro firms miss out on optimism more than 90% of large companies around the world are highly optimistic about their economic prospects  a survey of 1 300 bosses suggests.  their biggest worries are not terror threats  but over-regulation  low-cost competition and the wild ups and downs of oil prices. there is one exception: firms in western europe - but not the uk - are lacking confidence after years of slow growth. when business advisers pricewaterhousecoopers (pwc) conducted the same survey two years ago  nearly 30% of bosses were gloomy about their prospects.  global business leaders say that they are facing a two-pronged regulatory assault. after a string of corporate scandals in the united states - from enron to worldcom - the sarbanes-oxley act forces companies to be much more transparent  but doing all the paperwork costs a lot of time and money. across europe  meanwhile  all stock exchange-listed companies are currently in the process of moving to new and complex accounting standards called ifrs. hacking through the red tape can hardly be avoided  but many chief executives around the world appear to have decided on how to deal with low-cost competitors.  already  about 28% of the bosses polled for the survey say that they have moved parts of their business into low-wage countries  and another 11% plan to do so in the future. possibly as a result  the worry about low-cost competition has slightly fallen from last year  with just 54% of companies calling it a  significant threat  or  one of the biggest threats . but pwc s global chief executive  samuel dipiazza  said a growing number of companies were also concerned that moves to outsource work to cheaper countries could both hurt their reputation in their home markets and harm the quality of service they provide to their customers.  according to frank brown  global advisory leader at pwc   the trend of large companies to have global operations has one clear upside:  one risk in one region - for example the middle east - won t kill your business anymore.  surprisingly  the survey suggests that the rapid decline of the us dollar is not seen as a huge threat anymore  unlike even a year ago  when it was cited as the third-largest problem. mr dipiazza said the interviews with chief executives suggested that companies had  adjusted  to the new reality of a euro that buys $1.30 and more  while others had successfully hedged their positions and locked in more favourable exchange rates.    - for the survey  pricewaterhousecoopers interviewed 1 324 chief executives throughout the world during the last three months of 2004.,business
106,ireland 21-19 argentina an injury-time dropped goal by ronan o gara stole victory for ireland from underneath the noses of argentina at lansdowne road on saturday.  o gara kicked all of ireland s points  with two dropped goals and five penalties  to give the home side a 100% record in their autumn internationals. an impressive argentina appeared in control until the dying seconds. the pumas shocked the irish early on with a try from federico aramburu  and felipe contepomi kicked 14 points. the well-drilled and sharper pumas out-played and out-thought ireland in the early stages. indiscipline allowed argentina s leinster fly-half contepomi to open the scoring in the third minute with a straightforward penalty. he was on the mark again two minutes later when argentina shocked a ragged ireland with the first try of the game. ireland turned the ball over and manuel contepomi broke through an unstructured defence before feeding his midfield partner aramburu to sprint in under the posts. o gara finally got ireland on the board with a dropped goal in the ninth minute only for contepomi to rifle over his second penalty two minutes later. playing into a strong wind and rain  ireland continued to come second best in tight situations  and turnovers began to mount up against a rugged defence. o gara managed to land his second penalty in the 36th minute  but once again contepomi replied in kind four minutes into first-half injury time. the second-half started as the first had ended. o gara rifled over another penalty in the 45th minute  but contepomi matched it three minutes later. the upper-body strength of the pumas never allowed ireland to take control up front  while the three-quarters had no space to manoeuvre. ireland had to rely on o gara s boot to keep in touch rather than any contrived running plays. the munsterman landed two more penalties - one of them from 48 metres - to bring his team to within four points with 13 minutes on the clock remaining. and ireland s chance came when argentina s number eight gonzalo longo was yellow carded with six minutes to go for an offence in the line-out. o gara made no mistake as he rifled over his fifth penalty to set up a tense final few minutes. but ireland showed great composure to get themselves into a position to allow o gara to thump over a massive drop goal to complete a tremendous  if fortuitous  comeback.,sport
107,cyber criminals step up the pace so-called phishing attacks that try to trick people into handing over confidential details have boomed in 2004  say security experts.  the number of phishing e-mail messages stopped by security firm messagelabs has risen more than tenfold in less than 12 months. in 2004 it detected more than 18 million phishing e-mail messages. other statistics show that in 2004 73% of all e-mail was spam and one in 16 messages were infected with a virus.  in its end-of-year report  messagelabs said that phishing had become the top security threat and most popular form of attack among cyber criminals. in september 2003  messagelabs caught only 273 phishing e-mails that tried to make people visit fake versions of the websites run by real banks and financial organisations. but by september 2004 it was stopping more than two million phishing related e-mail messages per month. worryingly  said the firm  phishing gangs were using increasingly sophisticated techniques to harvest useful information such as login details or personal data.  older attacks relied on users not spotting the fact that the site they were visiting was fake  but more recent phishing e-mails simply try to steal details as soon as a message is opened. other phishing scams try to recruit innocent people into acting as middlemen for laundering money or goods bought with stolen credit cards.  e-mail security attacks remain unabated in their persistence and ferocity   said mark sunner  chief technology officer at messagelabs.  in just 12 months phishing has firmly established itself as a threat to any organisation or individual conducting business online   he said. mr sunner said messagelabs was starting to see some phishing attacks become very focused on one company or organisation.  already particular businesses are threatened and blackmailed  indicating a shift from the random  scattergun approach  to customised attacks designed to take advantage of the perceived weaknesses of some businesses   he said. although phishing attacks grew substantially throughout 2004  viruses and spam remain popular with cyber-criminals and vandals. one of the biggest outbreaks took place in january when the mydoom virus started circulating. to date the company has caught more than 60 million copies of the virus. also up this year was the amount of spam in circulation. in 2003 only 40% of messages were spam. but by the end of 2004  almost three-quarters of messages were junk.,tech

113,brown and blair face new rift claims for the umpteenth time  tony blair and gordon brown are said to have declared all out war on each other.  this time the alleged rift is over who should take the credit for the government s global aid and debt initiatives  particularly in the wake of the tsunami disaster - an issue many hoped and believed was above such things. it dominated the prime minister s monthly news conference  which saw mr blair start in full irritation mode as he was forced to bat away question after question about his relationship with his neighbour. as he told journalists:  i am not interested in what goes in and out of newspapers. there is a complete unity of purpose.  and he again heaped praise on mr brown saying he was doing a great job  and would continue doing it - although he would not commit to any job for mr brown after the election.  so why did he arrange his press conference at the last moment so it coincided with mr brown s long-arranged keynote speech on aid and debt  he was asked  by now mr blair had moved from irritation mode to his barely disguised fury setting. he snapped back that the hacks knew very well what the operational reasons were for the timing of his press conference. well  not really  as it happens.  and he repeated what a great man gordon was and how united they were  before again sneering that he took absolutely no notice of what went in and out of the newspapers  preferring to get on with the job of doing the best for the country and the world. although in the next breath he declared:  i get increasingly alarmed by what i read in the newspapers  before catching himself on and quickly adding:  in so far as i read them of course.  he probably had good reason to be alarmed because the newspapers had been full of stories about the claimed open warfare between the two men.  as far as the timing of the prime minister s press conference is concerned  there are two options. the first is that it was a calculated attempt to upstage the chancellor and seize back the initiative on the big issue of the moment. if that is the case it suggests that even the fear of seriously negative newspaper headlines is not enough to stop the squabbling. the second option is that it was an unavoidable coincidence  which would suggest the government has lost its once-famed ability to strictly co-ordinate announcements - through the infamous downing street grid - to avert just such allegations.  either way  the effect was the same - to overshadow the big announcements of government policy on a hugely pertinent issue. and there had been previous suggestions that the new year had started with a fresh outbreak of the warfare between the two men. firstly  the prime minister insisted on wednesday that he had been intimately involved in the development of the proposals to get g8 countries to freeze debt repayments from the tsunami-hit countries. it was claimed he had been embarrassed by the fact that gordon brown appeared to have taken the initiative over the government s response to the disaster while mr blair was still on holiday in egypt.  then  as if to pour fuel on the flames  both men separately spoke about working on tsunami or wider aid and development policy with their cabinet colleagues foreign secretary jack straw  aid minister hilary benn and deputy prime minister john prescott - without mentioning the other. all this came amid fresh claims that mr brown was still seething that he had been excluded from a prominent role in general election planning and had  as a result  started to set out his own platform. the fact that he used an article in the guardian newspaper to set out what he believed  should  be in the manifesto  has embarked on a mini tour of britain to set out his aid plans and will next week visit africa on the same mission - often seen as the prime minister s  turf  - has only added to the impression of rival camps operating entirely independently of each other. the prime minister denied all that as well  repeating his insistence that it was inconceivable the economy and the chancellor would not be at the centre of the election campaign. but the big fear with many on the labour benches now is that  unless a lid can be put on the speculation over the rivalry  it may even threaten to undermine the election campaign itself.,politics

122,choose hope over fear - kennedy voters will have a clear choice between the politics of fear and the politics of hope in the next general election  said charles kennedy.  in his new year message the liberal democrat leader said labour and the conservatives were united in relying on fear and  populist scares . he said his party was the one of hope and was ready for a 2005 poll. on the asian tsunami he said it had been  very heartening  to learn of the generosity being shown by britons. mr kennedy said his thoughts were with all those caught up in the disaster  which had dominated the christmas and new year period. at home he said many people were turning to the liberal democrats as they became disheartened with the politics of the other two main parties.  the general election would be a three-party struggle  as the conservative party  fades away  as a national force and the liberal democrats challenge labour in its heartlands  he said.  a clear division is emerging in british politics - the politics of fear versus the politics of hope.  labour is counting on the politics of fear  ratcheting up talk of threats  crime and insecurity. while the conservatives are re-working their populist scares about asylum and the european  menace    he said. he said the government was using this climate of fear to try to strip away civil liberties.  it was already using detention without trial at belmarsh prison  ignoring a recent law lords judgement that this contravenes basic human rights  he said. he also criticised attempts to bring in trial without jury  plans to lower the burden of proof in some criminal trials  curbing of rights to protest  increased stop and search powers and id card plans. he said while everyone had the right to be secure they also had the right to be protected against unfair discrimination.  but at the same time  an overmighty state is a dangerous one   he said. his party  instinctively  understood the  new liberal britain  which is no longer a nation with one family structure  and one colour  he said.  we are less deferential; more inclined to think for ourselves; more open about sexuality and equality.  our national institutions are changing too. we are no longer a nation of one church; we are a nation of many faiths. in our attitudes and the way we live our lives  this is in many ways a liberal britain.,politics
123,chelsea hold arsenal a gripping game between arsenal and chelsea ended with the honours finishing even at highbury.  thierry henry produced a sublime strike to put arsenal ahead but john terry levelled with a powerful header. henry s quickly-taken free-kick put arsenal back in front but eidur gudjohnsen equalised with a header from william gallas  knockback. henry missed a golden chance when he blazed a shot high late on and arsenal also had a penalty appeal rejected. henry s opener had given arsenal the perfect start and set up an enthralling affair. the french striker headed a long cesc faregas ball back to jose antonio reyes from the edge of the chelsea area and immediately saw it headed back into his path from the spaniard. and  with his back to goal  henry finished with aplomb when he took one touch  turned and struck an angled strike past the despairing dive of keeper petr cech. henry epitomised a determination about the arsenal side but chelsea appeared unruffled and equalised after 16 minutes.  gunners keeper manuel almunia  who got the nod ahead of jens lehmann  did well to save a well-struck frank lampard shot. but he could not keep out terry s powered header from the resultant corner as arsenal s weakness at set-pieces was again exposed. almost immediately  henry went close and chelsea gathered the loose ball before going straight up the other end where gudjohnsen fluffed an effort. gudjohnsen did not make the same error minutes later when he struck a sweet shot only for almunia to be equal to the task and save. the homes side regained the lead in controversial fashion when robert pires won a dubious free-kick. and  given the option to take the 25-yard set-piece quickly  henry curled in a shot with cech still organising his wall.  this time arsenal did not allow chelsea to level so soon as they went into the break ahead. chelsea brought striker didier drogba on to partner gudjohnsen up front after the interval and the move reaped immediate reward. lampard swung in a cross which gallas knocked back across goal and a deft header from gudjohnsen levelled matters again. chelsea s main threat was coming from crosses and lampard missed a great opportunity as he headed wide when left unmarked at the far post. the second half failed to live up to the thrilling pace of the opening period but there were flashes of brilliance. one of them came from the enigmatic robben when he jinked his way through two arsenal defenders only to see his poked shot saved by almunia.  arsenal ended the match the stronger and worked a excellent chance for henry who put a left-foot shot high from eight yards. subtitute robin van persie could also have nicked a win for the highbury outfit but frustratingly sidefooted just wide. matthieu flamini had a late penal appeal waved away before the final whistle which maintained chelsea five-point premiership lead over arsenal.  almunia  lauren  toure  campbell  cole  pires  flamini  fabregas  reyes (clichy 82)  bergkamp (van persie 82)  henry. subs not used: senderos  hoyte  lehmann.  cole.  henry 2  29.  cech  paulo ferreira  ricardo carvalho (drogba 45)  terry  gallas  duff  tiago (bridge 45)  makelele  lampard  robben  gudjohnsen (parker 77). subs not used: kezman  cudicini.  robben  drogba  lampard.  terry 17  gudjohnsen 46.  38 153  g poll (hertfordshire).,sport

125,tough rules for ringtone sellers firms that flout rules on how ringtones and other mobile extras are sold could be cut off from all uk phone networks.  the rules allow offenders to be cut off if they do not let consumers know exactly what they get for their money and how to turn off the services. the first month under the new rules has seen at least ten firms suspended while they clean up the way they work. the rules have been brought in to ensure that the problems plaguing net users do not spread to mobile phones.  in the last couple of years ringtones  wallpapers  screensavers and lots of other extras for phones have become hugely popular. but fierce competition is making it difficult for firms to get their wares in front of consumers  said jeremy flynn  head of third party services at vodafone.   if you are not on the operator s portal you are going to have quite heavy marketing costs because it s a problem of how people discover your services   he said. to combat this many ringtone and other mobile content sellers started using a new tactic to squeeze more cash out of customers. this tactic involved signing people up for a subscription to give them  for instance  several ringtones per week or month instead of the single track they thought they were getting. mr flynn said that the move to using subscriptions happened over the space of a few weeks at the end of 2004. websites such as grumbletext.co.uk started getting reports from customers who were racking up large bills for phone content they did not know they had signed up for.  what made us uncomfortable was that these services were not being marketed transparently   said mr flynn.  people did not know they were being offered a subscription service.   we saw potential for substantial consumer harm here   he added.  the swift adoption of subscription services led to the creation of a new code of conduct for firms that want to sell content for mobile phones. the drafting of the new rules was led by the mobile entertainment forum and the uk s phone firms.  everyone is required to conform to this code of conduct   said andrew bud  regulatory head of the mef and executive chairman of messaging firm mblox.   it s all about transparency   he said.  consumers have to be told what they have got themselves into and how to get out of it.   the consumer has a right to be protected   he said. christian harris  partnership manager of mobile content firm zed  said the new system was essential if consumers were to trust companies that sell ringtones and other downloads.  the groundrules must be applied across the whole industry and if that s done effectively we will see the cowboys driven out   he said. the new rules came in to force on 15 january and the first month under the new regime has seen many firms cautioned for not honouring them. some have been told to revamp websites so customers know what they get for their money and what they are signing up for  said mr flynn. also  said mr flynn  vodafone has briefly cut off between eight and ten content sellers flouting the rules.  we have quite draconian contracts with firms   he said.  we do not have to say why. we can just cut them off.  under the rules consumers must be able to switch off the services by using a universal  stop  command sent via text message. he said the system had been designed to limit how much a consumer will pay if they inadvertently signed up for a service.  the mobile is so personal that people really resent the abuse of what is effectively part of their personality   said mr flynn.,tech

127,henman overcomes rival rusedski tim henman saved a match point before fighting back to defeat british rival greg rusedski 4-6 7-6 (8-6) 6-4 at the dubai tennis championships on tuesday.  world number 46 rusedski broke in the ninth game to take a tight opening set. rusedski had match point at 6-5 in the second set tie-break after henman double-faulted  but missed his chance and henman rallied to clinch the set. the british number one then showed his superior strength to take the decider and earn his sixth win over rusedski. serve was held by both players with few alarms until the seventh game of the final set  when rusedski s wild volley gave henman a vital break. a furious rusedski slammed his racket onto the ground in disgust and was warned by the umpire.  henman  seeded three  then held his serve comfortably thanks to four serve-and-volley winners to take a clear 5-3 lead. rusedski won his service game but henman took the first of his three match points with a service winner to secure his place in the second round at dubai for the first time in three years. it was the first match between the pair for three years - henman last lost to rusedski six years ago - and lasted two hours and 40 minutes. the pair are now likely to only face each other on court as rivals - rather than as team-mates - after henman decided to retire from davis cup tennis leaving rusedski to lead the team out against israel on 4-6 march. henman  who now faces russian igor andreev in the last 16  admitted afterwards it was difficult coming up against his compatriot on a fast surface.  you just take it point by point when you re fighting to stay in the match   he said.  i had to keep playing aggressively and competing to get a chance.  i now have to recover in time for the next match because the body doesn t recover as quick as it used to  especially after two hours and 40 minutes.,sport

131,what now for kelly holmes  last april  kelly holmes spoke to the bbc sport website about her loneliness  her fight to stay fit and her decision not to contest both the 800m and 1500m at the olympics.  it just goes to show even the most meticulous and measured athletes cannot predict what fate has in store for them. four months later  holmes stormed to double olympic gold and has since been made a dame  won the bbc sport personality of the year and written a book whilst still finding time to coach aspiring athletes. with so much time spent in the spotlight  holmes has increasingly dropped hints that her ambition on the track has begun to wilt. and when asked about her plans for both the indoor and outdoor seasons ahead  the 34-year-old has repeatedly chosen to tick the  don t know  box. holmes has now pulled out of this weekend s european indoor championships  where she was selected for both the 800m and 1500m  because of a hamstring injury. but should we be surprised if the olympic champion over both those distances decides she just does not feel like racing anymore   well  it s a lot easier being the double olympic champion  being feted by everybody  than training to be at the top in middle distance running   points out former olympian and bbc pundit steve cram.  you have to have a real strong desire to carry on doing it even if you re very talented.   holmes  drive and determination have always been unquestionable - that is the reason she has battled back from a string of injuries that threatened to see her finish her career empty-handed. but alarm bells start ringing when the kent athlete begins questioning herself.  will i have as much commitment  desire and energy to go through a major championship   holmes asked in the new year.  that is what i don t know.  at 34  holmes will also be aware that time is running out. us 400m and 200m legend michael johnson  a five-time olympic gold medallist  retired shortly after his 34th birthday as did britain s double olympic champion decathlete daley thompson. the physical demands of the day-to-day grind will only get harder for holmes  who has already admitted she  doesn t like the training anymore.  whilst out on the circuit the allure of defeating a double olympic champion will spur her opponents on. holmes will not want to needlessly suffer the indignity of being beaten. unless she is certain she has a strong chance of winning any race  she will not step onto the track. but if the kent athlete finds the form that fuelled her ambitions last summer  there are more prizes up for grabs. the day after completing her double in athens  the 34-year-old revealed she would still like to win her first indoors title.  holmes  wish could easily be met in madrid before she goes on to prepare for the outdoor season where there are still scores to be settled  such as a first gold at the world championships in helsinki. there is just one small truth which could gnaw away at holmes  motivation - the realisation that no matter how hard she trains  nothing she wins now can surpass her achievements in athens. on the other hand  if those achievements cannot be matched shouldn t they be at least shared and celebrated   you don t get the chance very often in your career to step onto the track as the double olympic champion   agreed cram.  you want to be able to take your bow in front of the fans because it s a fantastic feeling.  i think deep down kelly wants to run. i think she will compete and run races on the circuits but whether or not she runs in the major championships is much less certain.   athletics fans had every reason to believe they would see the new-look kelly holmes tearing up the track again. after her olympic glory she emphatically denied she planned to retire. so  why is holmes dragging her heels about making a decision on where  when or whether to even bother competing again   that s just kelly   explains cram.  she s always been like that.  she enjoys people trying to guess what she is going to do next. she knows every time she makes a pronouncement now it s headline news.  kelly has to figure out for herself what it is she wants and that will be based on athletics decisions  whether she can be competitive  if she is fit enough to put her neck on the line.  and if she decides not to run again  no-one is going to turn round and say  you re making the wrong decision.,sport
132,verizon  seals takeover of mci  verizon has won a takeover battle for us phone firm mci with a bid worth $6.8bn (£3.6bn)  reports say.  the two firms are expected to seal the deal on monday morning  according to news agency reports  despite what was thought to be a higher bid from qwest. the us telecoms market is consolidating fast  with former long-distance giant at&t being bought by former subsidiary sbc earlier this year for $16bn. mci exited bankruptcy in april  having gone bust under previous name worldcom. the bankruptcy followed its admission in 2002 that it illegally booked expenses and inflated profits.  shareholders lost about $180bn when the company collapsed  while 20 000 workers lost their jobs. former worldcom boss bernie ebbers is currently on trial  accused of overseeing an $11bn fraud. qwest has itself come under suspicion of sub-standard behaviour  paying the securities and exchange commission $250m in october to settle charges that it manipulated its results to keep wall street happy.  mci is the us s second-biggest long distance firm after at&t. consolidation in the us telecommunications industry has picked up in the past few months as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases. a merger between mci and verizon would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since october. last week  sbc communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone trailblazer at&t for about $16bn. buying mci would give either qwest or verizon access to mci s global network and business-based subscribers. the rationale is similar to the one underpinning sbc s at&t deal. verizon is by far the bigger company and has its own successful mobile arm - factors which may have swung the board in its favour since both suitors are offering a mixture of cash and shares.,business
133,uk  discriminated against roma  the government s immigration rules racially discriminated against roma (gypsies) seeking entry into the uk  the law lords have ruled.  it follows a home office move to cut asylum claims by stopping people  mostly roma  from boarding flights to britain from the czech capital  prague. civil rights group liberty said it exposed  racism at the heart of the government s asylum policy . the home office said it had not meant to discriminate against anyone. it said it would look at the implications of the ruling  but pointed out the controls were no longer in place because czechs are now entitled to free movement across europe.  the screening took place at the airport in july 2001  at a time of concern about the number of asylum seekers entering britain.  those refused  pre-clearance  were effectively prevented from travelling to the uk  because no airline would carry them. lady hale  sitting with lords bingham  steyn  hope and carswell  said many roma had good reason to want to leave the czech republic because of persecution. but she said they were treated more sceptically than non-roma passengers by immigration officers  acting on racial grounds . lady hale said immigration officers should have treated all would-be passengers in the same way  only using more intrusive questioning if there was a specific reason.  liberty said statistics suggested roma czechs were 400 times more likely to be stopped by british immigration officials at prague airport than non-roma czechs. it took up the case of six unnamed roma czechs refused entry to britain  and that of the european roma rights centre  which said the measures unfairly penalised roma people. it lost a high court action in october 2002 when a judge said the system was  no more or less objectionable  than a visa control system. he ruled there was no obligation on britain not to take steps to prevent a potential refugee from approaching its border to claim asylum.  the court of appeal then decided the practice almost inevitably discriminated against roma  but that this was justified because they were more likely to seek asylum. immigration law allows officials to discriminate against citizens from named countries  but it does not allow officers to go further than that.  responding to the ruling  a home office spokesman said:  the scheme was operated two years ago as a short-term response to the high levels of passengers travelling from prague who are subsequently found to be ineligible for entry to the uk.   welcoming the ruling  maeve sherlock  chief executive of the refugee council  said:  human rights abuses against the roma in eastern europe are well documented  and it is hugely troubling that the government sought to deny entry to such a vulnerable group.  amnesty international s jan shaw said:  that the government s own asylum policy was being operated discriminatorily is bleakly ironic given that discrimination often lies at the heart of serious human rights abuse  not least in the czech republic.  but the chairman of migration watch uk  sir andrew green  said the house of lords decision was a  step in the wrong direction .  the basic point is that the government has a duty to control our borders and this decision appears to extend the race relations legislation beyond sensible limits.,politics

140,could yukos be a blessing in disguise  other things being equal  the notion of entrepreneurs languishing in jail while their companies are sold off for a song ought to be bad for business.  but in the looking-glass world of modern russia  the opposite might just be true  a new report* has argued. the study  from the centre for economic policy research  does not praise the rough handling of oil company yukos. but it argues that more rigorous tax policing has benefited all russian firms  even targets of the tax police.  an increase in tax enforcement can increase the amount [of dividends and other income] outside shareholders will receive  even accounting for increased levels of taxation   the authors say.  the paper s reasoning is complex  and is based on a sophisticated model of the relationship between tax regimes and corporate governance - in particular  the propensity of management to steal from the company. the calculations demonstrated what many russian analysts already knew: that increasing the tax rate increases the amount that managers steal  since undeclared income becomes relatively more valuable. in the west  meanwhile  higher tax rates translate far more smoothly into higher government revenues. on the other hand  increasing the rigour with which taxes are collected encourages companies to become more transparent  forcing them to be able to demonstrate their financial position far more accurately. the net result  the authors say  is that the extra amount companies pay in tax is more than compensated for by greater efficiency and financial soundness.  after vladimir putin became president in 2000  he did not raise taxes  but put a lot of effort - too much  critics argue - into enforcement.  since then  the russian stock market has more than trebled in value  a rise the authors attribute at least in part to the newly tough approach. the report highlights the case of sibneft  a russian oil company that came close to merging with yukos last year. after mr putin came to power  the company s overall effective tax rate rose from 2.6% to 10.4%  and sibneft was the target of a series of aggressive raids by fiscal police. but shareholders benefited hugely: sibneft started to pay dividends - $53m in 2000 and almost $1bn in 2001 - and closed down the network of opaque subsidiaries it had previously used for siphoning off unofficial funds. according to the authors  although a variety of changes were sweeping through russian industry at the time  the increase in tax enforcement is the only likely explanation for the change of fortunes at sibneft and many of its peers.  does this analysis make sense  in part  certainly. for all its faults  corporate russia has become far more orderly and law-abiding since 2000. companies have rushed to list their shares on international stock exchanges - something unthinkable in the wilder days of the 1990s - and most large firms now produce their accounts to international standards. foreign direct investment  long negligible  is starting to flow in serious amounts - $7bn in 2003 - and stock market returns have been among the healthiest in europe. but the authors  model does not quite cover all the complexities. for a start  the model assumes that the various parties have clearly-defined motivation: companies want to maximise profit  governments want to maximise tax revenue. in fact  the alarmingly close connections between big business and government in russia - connections often greased by bribery - blur the apparently antagonistic relationship. companies can  for example  persuade officials to overlook non-payment of taxes.  and the authors  definition of tax enforcement seems unrealistically western. genuine  disinterested tax collection might well work wonders in russia; the problem with recent examples has been the erratic and unpredictable way laws are enforced. the case against yukos  for example  has moved in fits and starts  with little clarity from the government about its intentions  and little faith from investors that the letter of the law would be followed. as far as most commentators are concerned  the state is pursuing yukos out of a political vendetta  rather than simply to enforce fiscal rectitude. since yukos  founder  mikhail khodorkovsky  was arrested a year ago  the russian market has dropped by 10% - an indication that few investors feel optimistic about the salutary effect on corporate performance.,business

143,mci shares climb on takeover bid shares in us phone company mci have risen on speculation that it is in takeover talks.  the wall street journal reported on thursday that qwest has bid $6.3bn (£3.4bn) for mci. other firms have also expressed an interest in mci  the second-largest us long-distance phone firm  and may now table rival bids  analysts said. shares in mci  which changed its name from worldcom when it emerged from bankruptcy  were up 2.4% at $20.15. press reports suggest that qwest and mci may reach an agreement as early as next week  although rival bids may muddy the waters. the largest us telephone company verizon has previously held preliminary merger discussions with mci  reuters quoted sources as saying.  consolidation in the us telecommunications industry has picked up in the past few months as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases. a merger between mci and qwest would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since october. last week  sbc communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone trailblazer at&t for about $16bn. competition has intensified and fixed-line phone providers such as mci and at&t have seen themselves overtaken by rivals. buying mci would give qwest  a local phone service provider  access to mci s global network and business-based subscribers. mci also offers internet services.  mci was renamed after it emerged from chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in april last year. it hit the headlines as worldcom in 2002 after admitting it illegally booked expenses and inflated profits. the scandal was a key factor in a global slide in share prices and the reverberations are still being felt today. shareholders lost about $180bn when the company collapsed  while 20 000 workers lost their jobs. former worldcom boss bernie ebbers is currently on trial  accused of overseeing an $11bn fraud.,business

146,net fingerprints combat attacks eighty large net service firms have switched on software to spot and stop net attacks automatically.  the system creates digital fingerprints of ongoing incidents that are sent to every network affected. firms involved in the smart sensing system believe it will help trace attacks back to their source. data gathered will be passed to police to help build up intelligence about who is behind worm outbreaks and denial of service attacks.  firms signing up for the sensing system include mci  bt  deutsche telekom  energis  ntt  bell canada and many others. the creation of the fingerprinting system has been brokered by us firm arbor networks and signatures of attacks will be passed to anyone suffering under the weight of an attack. increasingly computer criminals are using swarms of remotely controlled computers to carry out denial of service attacks on websites  launch worms and relay spam around the net.  we have seen attacks involving five and ten gigabytes of traffic   said rob pollard  sales director for arbor networks which is behind the fingerprinting system.  attacks of that size cause collateral damage as they cross the internet before they get to their destination   he said. once an attack is spotted and its signature defined the information will be passed back down the chain of networks affected to help every unwitting player tackle the problem.  mr pollard said arbor was not charging for the service and it would pass on fingerprint data to every network affected.  what we want to do is help net service firms communicate with each other and then push the attacks further and further back around the world to their source   said mr pollard. arbor network s technology works by building up a detailed history of traffic on a network. it spots which computers or groups of users regularly talk to each other and what types of traffic passes between machines or workgroups. any anomaly to this usual pattern is spotted and flagged to network administrators who can take action if the traffic is due to a net-based attack of some kind. this type of close analysis has become very useful as net attacks are increasingly launched using several hundred or thousand different machines. anyone looking at the traffic on a machine by machine basis would be unlikely to spot that they were all part of a concerted attack.  attacks are getting more diffuse and more sophisticated   said malcolm seagrave  security expert at energis.  in the last 12 months it started getting noticeable that criminals were taking to it and we ve seen massive growth.  he said that although informal systems exist to pass on information about attacks  often commercial confidentiality got in the way of sharing enough information to properly combat attacks.,tech

148,labour mps  fears over squabbling if there is one thing certain to stiffen the spines of labour mps it is the prospect of losing their seats at a general election.  and it was largely that fear that led to tony blair and gordon brown being read the riot act during a meeting of the parliamentary labour party. the views expressed by both backbenchers and labour peers over the claimed squabbling between the two men starkly demonstrated the widely-held view within the labour party that the two most powerful figures in the government are jeopardising the next election. as one hugely-disgruntled backbencher said before the meeting:  it is time they realised it s not just my seat they are threatening but if they go on like this they could put the election in doubt.  it is a sentiment that is now running throughout the labour benches with mps eager to underline the message to their leaders to stop the squabbling and get on with the job at hand.  as paul flynn said:  what has deeply upset the party is in this time of all times  when we wanted to come together  we wanted to lead on the global issues  to change politics for the next decade  the whole thing was wrecked by a piece of childishness by the two main people in the party  two people we greatly respect.   stephen pound echoed the message  saying:  we know that the one thing that could entirely jeopardise what we are trying to achieve  not for the labour party but for this country  is the appearance of division. we remember the 1980s . they backed the suggestion that unless the squabbling stopped  the people briefing on behalf of the two men would be  named and shamed . the dressing down appears to have done the trick  with mr brown joining his alleged rival alan milburn - who the prime minister put in charge of election planning in mr brown s stead - and deputy prime minister john prescott at an election poster launch. but the effect of all this is to have achieved two things. firstly  nobody is attempting to suggest any more that the stories of the rift between the chancellor and the prime minister are fictions created by the media and authors. even mr prescott admitted that  had he still been a backbencher  he would have been giving mr blair and mr brown the same message.  secondly it has also underlined the view that the election campaign has  to all intents and purposes  kicked off. but whether the telling off and the subsequent change in behaviour by the two men will do any good - or can even be sustained through the campaign - remains to be seen.  even as the mps were expressing their fears it emerged that  while mr brown is in africa for a week  the prime minister is to deliver a keynote speech on election themes for a third term. and he is expected to repeat his recent insistence that the next manifesto will be  new  labour through and through. similarly  some were pointing out that the chancellor  during the election poster launch  once again refused to deny the claim that he told the prime minister he could never trust anything he said. none the less  what some believe now is that the effect of the warnings from the backbenchers will actually be to silence the brown camp  effectively strengthening the prime minister s hand. for example  will those brownite briefers suggest their man is unhappy at the prime minister s timing or subject matter  as may have been the case in the past  what all seem agreed on  however  is that this sniping simply cannot be allowed to go on through the election campaign. mind you  we have heard similar pledges before.,politics
149,freeze on anti-spam campaign a campaign by lycos europe to target spam-related websites appears to have been put on hold.  earlier this week the company released a screensaver that bombarded the sites with data to try to bump up the running costs of the websites. but the site hosting the screensaver now displays a pink graphic and the words  stay tuned . no one at lycos was available for comment on latest developments in its controversial anti-spam campaign.  lycos europe s  make love not spam  campaign was intended as a way for users to fight back against the mountain of junk mail flooding inboxes. people were encouraged to download the screensaver which  when their pc was idle  would then send lots of data to sites that peddle the goods and services mentioned in spam messages. lycos said the idea was to get the spam sites running at 95% capacity and generate big bandwidth bills for the spammers behind the sites. but the plan has proved controversial.  monitoring firm netcraft analysed response times for some of the sites targeted by the screensaver and found that a number were completely knocked offline.  the downing of the sites could dent lycos claims that what it is doing does not amount to a distributed denial of service attack. in such attacks thousands of computers bombard sites with data in an attempt to overwhelm them. laws in many countries do not explicitly outlaw such attacks but many nations are re-drafting computer use laws to make them specific offences. lycos europe now appears to have put the plan on hold. the site hosting the screensaver currently shows a holding page  with the words   stay tuned . the numerical internet address of the site has also changed. this is likely to be in response to spammers who have reportedly redirected traffic from their sites back to the lycos screensaver site. the campaign has come under fire from some corners of the web. many discussion groups have said that it set a dangerous precedent and could incite vigilantism.  attacking a spammer s website is like poking a grizzly bear sleeping in your back garden with a pointy stick   said graham cluley  senior technology consultant for sophos.  not only is this screensaver similar in its approach to a potentially illegal distributed denial of service attack  but it also is in danger of turning innocent computer users into vigilantes  who may not be prepared for whatever retaliation the spammers care to dream up.,tech

153,woolf murder sentence rethink plans to give murderers lighter sentences if they plead guilty have been watered down.  there was an outcry three months ago when the sentencing guidelines council - led by lord woolf - published its proposals for england and wales. it had suggested judges should reduce sentences by a third for murderers who confessed at the earliest opportunity. but that has now been changed to one-sixth  with no reduction for those killers given a  whole life tariff . at the time lord woolf  the lord chief justice  had said the one third reduction would only be in extraordinary circumstances - for example  if people gave themselves up before their crime had even been detected. the guidelines were to recognise the need to spare victims and witnesses the trauma of going to court where possible  by allowing lighter sentences for guilty pleas and co-operation  he said.  but director of the victims of crime trust  norman brennan  accused lord woolf of having an  arrogant contempt for victims of crime and the law-abiding public . the national association of probation officers said the move would be  political suicide . in revised proposals from the sentencing guidelines council (sgc)  the section on murder said possible reductions would have to be  weighed carefully  by a judge so they did not lead to  an inappropriately short sentence . where it was appropriate to reduce the minimum term having regard to a plea of guilty  the maximum reduction would be one sixth  and should never exceed five years  it said.  in a statement issued on wednesday lord woolf said:  i have no doubt that being able to call on the diverse backgrounds and experiences of all those that serve on the sgc has vastly improved the final guidelines.  i am confident  as a result  that judges will be better placed to deliver sentences which are effective both as punishments and deterrents to offending and reoffending.  director of public prosecutions  ken macdonald qc  who sits on the sgc  said the principle of discounting sentences to offenders for early guilty pleas is set down by parliament.  what the new guideline on reduced sentences for guilty pleas does is increase the chances of convicting the guilty by bringing clarity to this process.  it represents a tougher regime than existed previously  because the discount is automatically reduced if a guilty plea is not made at the first available opportunity   he said.,politics
154,moya emotional after davis cup win carlos moya described spain s davis cup victory as the highlight of his career after he beat andy roddick to end the usa s challenge in seville.  moya made up for missing spain s 2000 victory through injury by beating roddick 6-2 7-6 (7-1) 7-6 (7-5) to give the hosts an unassailable 3-1 lead.  i have woken up so many nights dreaming of this day   said moya.  all my energy has been focused on today.  what i have lived today i do not think i will live again.  spain s only other davis cup title came two years ago in valencia  when they beat australia. and moya  nicknamed charly  admitted:  the davis cup is my dream and i was a bit nervous at the outset.  some people have said that i am obsessed but i think that it is better this way. it helps me reach my goals if i am obsessed.  it s really incredible - to get the winning point is really something.  spanish captain jordi arrese said:  charly played a great game. it was his opportunity and he hasn t let us down.  he had lost three times to roddick  and this was his day to beat him.  he had been waiting years to be in this position.  spain s victory was also remarkable for the performance of rafael nadal  who beat roddick in the opening singles.  aged 18 years and 185 days  the mallorcan became the youngest player to win the davis cup.  what a great way to finish the year   said nadal afterwards. us coach patrick mcenroe wants roddick and the rest of his team to play more tennis on clay and hone their skills on the surface.  i think it will help these guys even on slow hard courts to learn how to mix things up a little bit and to play a little bit smarter and tactically better.   obviously it s unrealistic to say that we re going to just start playing constantly on clay  with the schedule.  but certainly i think we can put the work in at the appropriate time and play a couple more events and play against these guys who are the best on this stuff   said mcenroe. roddick was left frustrated after losing both his singles on the slow clay of seville s olympic stadium.  it s just tough because i felt like i was in it the whole time against one of the top three clay-courters in the world   said the american.  i had my chances and just didn t convert them. the bottom line is they were just better than us this weekend.  they came out  took care of business and they beat us. it s as simple as that.,sport
155,bomb threat at bernabeu stadium spectators were evacuated from real madrid s bernabeu stadium on sunday following a bomb scare during the game between the hosts and real sociedad.  more than 70 000 people abandoned the ground with the score at 1-1 and only three minutes left to play. the basque newspaper gara apparently received a telephone call saying a bomb was due to explode at 2100 local time. but after searching the stadium with sniffer dogs  the police said that no explosive device had been found.   the police have said they have completed their search and have not found anything   said real madrid president florentino perez.  the best thing we can all do now is to put this nightmare behind us.  madrid midfielder guti told private spanish radio station cadena ser:  i have never seen this before and sport should be above it all.  real took the lead just before the break when brazilian striker ronaldo cracked home with his left foot. sociedad levelled the match midway through the second half when turkish striker nihat kahveci smashed home with an acrobatic finish. it is not yet clear if the remaining three minutes of the game will be played at a later date or if the result will be allowed to stand.  if the result remains at 1-1  real will drop to third place in the standings  11 points behind leaders barcelona  who snatched a late 2-1 win at albacete on saturday. initial reports suggested the basque separatist group eta may be responsible for the bomb threat after issuing similar warnings before a series of small explosions in recent days. the bernabeu was targeted by eta on 1 may  2002  when madrid were about to play fc barcelona in a champions league semi-final. a car bomb exploded in a street outside the stadium and 17 people were slightly injured.,sport
156,man utd to open books to glazer manchester united s board has agreed to give us tycoon malcolm glazer access to its books.  earlier this month  mr glazer presented the board with detailed proposals on an offer to buy the football club. in a statement  the club said it would allow mr glazer  limited due diligence  to give him the opportunity to take the proposal on to a formal bid. but it said it continued to oppose mr glazer s plans  calling his assumptions  aggressive  and his plan  damaging . many of manchester united s supporters own shares in the club  and the fan-based group shareholders united is strongly opposed to any takeover by mr glazer. about 300 fans protested outside the old trafford ground two days ago.  rival local club manchester city has pleaded with visiting fans not to protest inside its ground when the two teams play a televised match on sunday.  manchester united s response comes as little surprise  as the board made clear.  any board has a responsibility to consider a bona fide offer proposal   the club said in its statement. should it become a firm offer  it should be at a price that  the board is likely to regard as fair  and on terms which  may be deliverable . but it also stressed that it stayed opposed to mr glazer s proposal.  the board continues to believe that mr glazer s business plan assumptions are aggressive   the statement said   and the direct and indirect financial strain on the business could be damaging.  whether or not the bid is attractive in monetary terms  in the case of manchester united many investors hold the stock for sentimental rather than financial reasons. at present  mr glazer and his family hold a 28.1% stake  making them manchester united s second biggest shareholders. they own the successful tampa bay buccaneers american football team based in florida. if the family makes a formal offer  they will need the support of the club s biggest shareholders.  irish horse racing millionaires jp mcmanus and john magnier own 29% of united through their investment vehicle cubic expression  and have yet to express a view on the bid approach.  a group of five mps are calling on the department of trade and industry to block any takeover of the club by the us football magnate on public interest grounds. they have signed a house of commons motion  and tony lloyd  the manchester central mp  whose constituency includes the club s old trafford ground  has pledged to take the matter  to tony blair if necessary . the commons motion says  any takeover designed to transform the club into a private company would be against the interests of those supporters and football . however  the dti has dismissed the proposal. a spokesman said the department did not believe there was a case for changing the enterprise act so that takeovers of football clubs could be looked at on non-competition grounds. mr glazer s offer values the club at £800m ($1.5bn). pitched at 300p per share  it also relies less on debt to finance it than an earlier approach from the us tycoon  which was rejected out of hand. manchester united shares closed at 270.25p on friday  down 3.75p on the day.,business

164,ireland win eclipses refereeing  errors  the international rugby board may have to step in to stop frustrated coaches and players from publicly haranguing referees when things go belly-up.  it may have to go the whole way and have nfl-style video cameras all over the field  or slap the vociferous perpetrators over the knuckles. what the irb does not want is a football scenario where the verbal slanging matches often overshadow the game itself. sunday s explosive six nations clash at lansdowne road was a good example as ireland took another step towards their first grand slam since 1948. the game was as exciting as it comes  with a much-improved england side enraged at a few decisions that did not go their way. one can understand that frustration. there was no doubt that ireland had the rub of the green in their 19-13 victory  but the reaction from the england camp may not have endeared them to the sport s  blazers . referee jonathan kaplan was not perfect by any means and two decisions in particular made him the villain of the piece. i doubt whether kaplan would have been too pleased at the comments made. after all  he has no public recourse to criticism.  it was the same for simon mcdowell  the touch judge who was heavily criticised by scotland coach matt williams after their defeat against france. as far as england were concerned  there were queries over mark cueto s first half-effort when he went over in the corner from a charlie hodgson kick.  england coach andy robinson referred to a similar case at ravenhill in january when ulster were playing gloucester in the heineken cup. on that occasion  david humphreys kicked to tommy bowe  who touched down in the corner only for the try to be wiped out. but you cannot have cameras at every conceivable angle to pick up such anomalies. perhaps robinson was right to say the referee should have gone upstairs when josh lewsey was driven over the irish line near the end.  lewsey claims he touched it down and was in full control. however  one has to credit ireland flanker johnny o connor for cleverly scooping the ball away and blocking any evidence of a touchdown. but in rugby  everything tends to even out over the 80 minutes. the referee also missed england s danny grewcock taking out ronan o gara off the ball to allow martin corry a sunday stroll to the line. those were the stand-out moments in a classic game between the two old foes.  but there were many more  and one should not take away from those. brian o driscoll s winning try was as well-conceived as they come  while charlie hodgson s brilliant kicking display was another highlight. and ronan o gara s tremendous ability to control the game was also a crucial component. but the defining moments came with ireland under the cosh in the final 15 minutes. two outstanding pieces of defensive play denied england and allowed ireland to hold on. the first was denis hickie s brilliant double tackle in the right-hand corner. he gobbled up cueto from another hodgson cross-field kick  then regained his feet to stop lewsey from scoring a certain try. ireland s second-row colossus paul o connell was equally superb. england had turned ireland one way then the other  and the defence cordon was slowly disintegrating. england prop matt stevens ran in at full steam to suck in a few more tacklers. unfortunately he ran into o connell who hit him hard - very hard - and then wrestled the ball away for a crucial turnover. that spoke volumes about ireland s back-foot display  with defensive coach mike ford taking a bow at the end. to win a game like that showed that ireland have moved forward. it may be tries that win games  but it is defence that wins championships.,sport

176,domain system opens door to scams a system to make it easier to create website addresses using alphabets like cyrillic could open a back door for scammers  a trade body has warned.  the internationalised domain names system has been a work in progress for years and has recently been approved by the internet engineering task force. but the uk internet forum (ukif) is concerned that the system will let scammers create fake sites more easily. the problem lies in the computer codes used to represent language.  registering names that look like that of legitimate companies but lead users to fake sites designed to steal passwords and credit card details could become a whole lot easier for determined scammers  says stephen dyer  director of ukif. domain names are the  real language  addresses of websites  rather than their internet protocol address  which is a series of numbers. they are used so people can more easily navigate the web. so-called ascii codes are used to represent european languages but for other languages a hybrid of a system called unicode is used. so  for example  website paypal could now be coded using a mixture of the latin alphabet and the russian alphabet. the resulting domain as displayed to the users would look identical to the real site as a russian  a  look just like an english  a . but the computer code would be different  and the site it would lead users to could be a fake. this is more than just a theory. a fake paypal.com has already been registered with net domain giant verisign by someone who has followed the debate around the internationalised domain name (idn) system  said mr dyer. as the idea was to prove a point rather than be malicious the fake domain has now been handed back to paypal but it sets a worrying precedent  mr dyer said.  although the idn problem is well known in technical circles  the commercial world is totally unaware how easily their websites can be faked   said mr dyer.   it is important to alert users that there is a new and invisible and almost undetectable way of diverting them to what looks like a perfectly genuine site   he added. there are solutions. for instance  browsers could spot domains that use mixed characters and display them in different colours as a warning to users. mr dyer acknowledged that it would be a huge undertaking to update all the world s browsers. another solution  to introduce idn-disabled browsers could be a case of  throwing out the baby with the bath water   he said. centr  the council of european national top level domain registries  agrees.  a rush to introduce idn-disabled browsers into the marketplace is an overly-zealous step that will harm public confidence in idns - a technology that is desperately needed in the non-english speaking world   the organisation said in a statement.,tech
177,howard rebuts asylum criticisms tory leader michael howard has gone on the offensive in response to people questioning how a son of immigrants can propose asylum quotas.  mr howard  whose parents fled the nazi threat to come to the uk  says the claim would mean no-one from an immigrant family could become premier. his comments come in a bbc documentary called  no more mr nasty . tv presenter anne robinson said as home secretary he gave the impression he would  like to kick your cat . ms robinson  a friend of the tory leader  also revealed that as a cambridge student mr howard was  much loved by women and he was a courteous and kind and rather dashing lover  - although she denied having personal experience.  i wasn t at cambridge - and it s not personal experience - but i know people who were.   documentary maker michael cockerell was given behind-the-scenes access to mr howard for his film portrait. the tory leader was asked about to respond to people who said that if there had there been a quota on immigration and asylum in the 1930s  his parents might not have been allowed into the country.  he replies:  what is the inference of that   that if you reach the view that you need to control immigration in the interests of the country you re not allowed to put a view forward if you happen to be descended from immigrants   that seems to me an absolutely extraordinary proposition  it would certainly mean no one from immigrant parents could be prime minister.   ms robinson  who presents the weakest link tells cockerell that she despaired at his hardline image when he was home secretary in john major s government.  i used to have to sit on my hands because he d get on television and give a passable impression of someone who d like to kick your cat or would put your baby in prison if he cried. i mean it was very  very draconian.  the film shows mr howard laughing at rory bremner s impression of him as dracula  which he calls  good fun   apart from the serious falsehood of a comment suggesting he wants fewer black people in the uk. the film shows the private side of the tory leader watching television at home or playing table tennis with his wife  ex-model sandra. asked if she enjoys a game of ping pong she confesses:  yeah  it would be more enjoyable if i could win occasionally too  but otherwise it s quite fun.   former downing street communications chief alastair campbell  now working on labour s election campaign  says a  touchy-feely  image does not fit mr howard. he says tony blair was not worried by his opponents  early performance in their commons clashes because mr howard lacked a  big strategy   including on issues like iraq. the tory leader brands such criticisms as  absolutely rubbish   arguing that he has been consistent on his support for the war but critical of mr blair s failure to tell the truth on intelligence. former tory chancellor ken clarke says mr howard has a bigger problem changing perceptions of the tory party than his personal image. mr clarke says the party is improving and it is  conceivable  it could win the next election. but he adds:  it has got to change itself a bit and broaden its appeal.   - michael howard: no more mr nasty is being shown on bbc2 on saturday 12 february at 2005 gmt.,politics
178,strong dollar  call halts slide the us dollar s slide against the euro and yen has halted after us treasury secretary john snow said a strong dollar was  in america s interest .  but analysts said any gains are likely to be short-lived as problems with the us economy were still significant. they also pointed out that positive comments apart  president george w bush s administration had done little to stop the dollar s slide. a weak dollar helps boost exports and narrow the current account deficit. the dollar was trading at $1.2944 against the euro at 2100gmt  still close to the $1.3006 record level set on 10 november. against the japanese yen  it was trading at 105.28 yen  after hitting a seven-month low of 105.17 earlier in the day.  policy makers in europe have called the dollar s slide  brutal  and have blamed the strength of the euro for dampening economic growth. however  it is unclear whether ministers would issue a declaration aimed at curbing the euro s rise at a monthly meeting of eurozone ministers late on monday. higher growth in europe is regarded by us officials as a way the huge us current account deficit - that has been weighing on the dollar - could be reduced. mr snow who is currently in dublin at the start of a four-nation eu visit  has applauded ireland s introduction of lower taxes and deregulation which have helped boost growth.  the eurozone is growing below its potential. when a major part of the global economy is below potential there are negative consequences... for the citizens of those economies... and for their trading partners   he said. mr snow s comments may have helped shore up the dollar on monday  but he was careful to qualify his statement.   our basic policy  of course  is to let open  competitive markets set the values   he explained.  markets are driven by fundamentals and towards fundamentals.  us officials have also said that other economies need to grow  so the us is not the main global growth engine. economists say that the fundamentals  or key indicators  of the us economy are looking far from rosy. domestic consumer demand is cooling  and heavy spending by president bush has pushed the budget deficit to a record $427bn (£230bn). the current account deficit  meanwhile  hit a record $166bn in the second quarter of 2004. for many analysts  a weaker dollar is here to stay.  no end is in sight   said carsten fritsch  a strategist at commerzbank .  it is only a matter of time until the euro reaches $1.30.  some analysts maintain the us is secretly happy with a lower dollar which helps makes its exports cheaper in europe  thus boosting its economy.,business

180,text messages aid disaster recovery text messaging technology was a valuable communication tool in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster in asia.  the messages can get through even when the cell phone signal is too weak to sustain a spoken conversation. now some are studying how the technology behind sms could be better used during an emergency. sanjaya senanayake works for sri lankan television. the blogging world  though  might know him better by his online name  morquendi. he was one of the first on the scene after the tsunami destroyed much of the sri lankan coast. cell phone signals were weak. land lines were unreliable. so mr senanayake started sending out text messages. the messages were not just the latest news they were also an on-the-ground assessment of  who needs what and where . blogging friends in india took mr senanayake s text messages and posted them on a weblog called dogs without borders. thousands around the world followed the story that unfolded in the text messages that he sent.  and that s when mr senanayake started to wonder if sms might be put to more practical use.  sms networks can handle so much more traffic than the standard mobile phone call or the land line call   he says.   in every rural community  there s at least one person who has access to a mobile phone  or has a mobile phone  and can receive messages.  half a world away  in the caribbean nation of trinidad and tobago  taran rampersad read morquendi s messages. mr rampersad  who used to work in the military  knew how important on the ground communication can be in times of disaster. he wondered if there might be a way to automatically centralise text messages  and then redistribute them to agencies and people who might be able to help. mr rampersad said:  imagine if an aid worker in the field spotted a need for water purification tablets  and had a central place to send a text message to that effect.  he can message the server  so the server can send out an e-mail message and human or machine moderators can e-mail aid agencies and get it out in the field.  he added:  or  send it at the same time to other people who are using sms in the region  and they might have an excess of it  and be able to shift supplies to the right places.   mr rampersad and others had actually been thinking about such a system since hurricane ivan ravaged the caribbean and the southern united states last september. last week  he sent out e-mail messages asking for help in creating such a system for asia.  in only 72 hours  he found dan lane  a text message guru living in britain. the pair  along with a group of dedicated techies  are creating what they call the alert retrieval cache. the idea is to use open-source software - software can be used by anyone without commercial restraint - and a far-flung network of talent to create a system that links those in need with those who can help.  this is a classic smart mobs situation where you have people self-organizing into a larger enterprise to do things that benefit other people   says paul saffo  a director at the california-based institute for the future.  you may be halfway around the world from someone  but in cyberspace you re just one click or one e-mail away   he said   that s put a whole new dimension on disaster relief and recovery  where often people halfway around the world can be more effective in making something happen precisely because they re not right on top of the tragedy.  it is still very early days for the project  though. in an e-mail  dan lane calls it  an early proof of concept.  right now  the alert retrieval cache can only take a text message and automatically upload it to a web-page  or distribute it to an e-mail list. in the near future  the group says it hopes to take in messages from people in affected areas  and use human moderators to take actions based on the content of those messages. but there s still another challenge. you have to get people to know that the system is there for them to use.  it s amazing how difficult it is to find someone to pass it along to  and say  look this is what we re trying to do and everything like that   says mr rampersad.  so the big problem right now is the same problem we re trying to solve - human communication.  he is optimistic  however. he thinks that the alert retrieval cache is an idea whose time has come and he hopes governments  too  will sit up and take notice. and he stands by his motto  courtesy of michelangelo: criticise by creating.  clark boyd is technology correspondent for the world  a bbc world service and wgbh-boston co-production.,tech
181,looks and music to drive mobiles mobile phones are still enjoying a boom time in sales  according to research from technology analysts gartner.  more than 674 million mobiles were sold last year globally  said the report  the highest total sold to date. the figure was 30% more than in 2003 and surpassed even the most optimistic predictions  gartner said. good design and the look of a mobile  as well as new services such as music downloads  could go some way to pushing up sales in 2005  said analysts. although people were still looking for better replacement phones  there was evidence  according to gartner  that some markets were seeing a slow-down in replacement sales.   all the markets grew apart from japan which shows that replacement sales are continuing in western europe   mobile analyst carolina milanesi told the bbc news website.  japan is where north america and western european markets can be in a couple of years  time.  they already have tv  music  ringtones  cameras  and all that we can think of on mobiles  so people have stopped buying replacement phones.   but there could be a slight slowdown in sales in european and us markets too  according to gartner  as people wait to see what comes next in mobile technology. this means mobile companies have to think carefully about what they are offering in new models so that people see a compelling reason to upgrade  said gartner. third generation mobiles (3g) with the ability to handle large amounts of data transfer  like video  could drive people into upgrading their phones  but ms milanesi said it was difficult to say how quickly that would happen.  at the end of the day  people have cameras and colour screens on mobiles and for the majority of people out there who don t really care about technology the speed of data to a phone is not critical.  nor would the rush to produce two or three megapixel camera phones be a reason for mobile owners to upgrade on its own. the majority of camera phone models are not at the stage where they can compete with digital cameras which also have flashes and zooms.  more likely to drive sales in 2005 would be the attention to design and aesthetics  as well as music services. the motorola razr v3 phone was typical of the attention to design that would be more commonplace in 2005  she added. this was not a  women s thing   she said  but a desire from men and women to have a gadget that is a form of self-expression too. it was not just about how the phone functioned  but about what it said about its owner.  western europe has always been a market which is quite attentive to design   said ms milanesi.   people are after something that is nice-looking  and together with that  there is the entertainment side.  this year music will have a part to play in this.  the market for full-track music downloads was worth just $20 million (£10.5 million) in 2004  but is set to be worth $1.8 billion (£9.4 million) by 2009  according to jupiter research. sony ericsson just released its walkman branded mobile phone  the w800  which combines a digital music player with up to 30 hours  battery life  and a two megapixel camera. in july last year  motorola and apple announced a version of itunes online music downloading service would be released which would be compatible with motorola mobile phones. apple said the new itunes music player would become motorola s standard music application for its music phones. but the challenge will be balancing storage capacity with battery life if mobile music hopes to compete with digital music players like the ipod. ms milanesi said more models would likely be released in the coming year with hard drives. but they would be more likely to compete with the smaller capacity music players that have around four gigabyte storage capacity  which would not put too much strain on battery life.,tech

192,council tax rise  reasonable  welsh councils should set their taxes at  reasonable levels  after being given an average funding increase of 6%  says the assembly government.  finance minister sue essex said it was a  good deal  for local government. the £3.2bn settlement includes the  full  £7.4m from the uk treasury announced by chancellor gordon brown. but opposition parties said rebanding of council taxes would mean steep rises. in addition  £13.4m will come from the business support grant - a scheme which enables local authorities to keep part of business rates. she said where spending rises were kept to around 5% she was  confident that councils will be able to set council taxes at reasonable levels.  the welsh local government association (wlga) had said on the eve of the announcement said that  significant  cuts to services may still be unavoidable. after the announcement wlga finance spokesman bob wellington  of torfaen  said it was vital that rises were minimsed.  a limited amount of money has come available but this is not the answer to our problems   said mr wellington.  it is vital that we start now to plan for future years and accept that resources will continue to reduce while pressures on services increase.  on monday  a delegation of north wales councils visited ms essex to lobby for increased funds. ms essex said:  i have listened to the views of local government and council tax payers and recognise the funding pressures and the concerns they have about council tax rises.  i have met a large number of local authorities in recent weeks and i am aware of the pressures on them to provide local services and keep down the level of council tax  particularly for those people to are moving up a band due to the revaluation of domestic properties.  she said council taxes could be kept at reasonable levels   even for those people who have moved up a band .  the settlement includes a rise in the grant to help councils with the most deprived communities and a 16.4% rise in capital expenditure support. ms essex said:  this is a good deal for local government  which will allow the well-managed councils of wales to develop their services and charge reasonable levels of council tax. it is now a matter for council leaders to manage their budgets at a local level.  plaid cymru s local government spokesman dai lloyd called the announcement  hugely disappointing . he said:  wales and its local authorities have been short changed yet again. this is not whinging as the labour assembly government so often claims - it is anger.   this will mean either a massive hike in council tax  massive cuts in services provided by councils  or both.  mike german  leader of the liberal democrats in the assembly  claimed that one in three homes were still likely to face council tax rises due to rebanding. mr german said:  i know from my discussions with welsh liberal democrat council leaders that they are doing their utmost to keep council tax to a minimum. but the random redistribution effect of rebanding...will create a great deal of difficulty.  conservative local government spokesman glyn davies said that for the minister to claim that the majority of council tax payers in wales should see very little change  is taking spin to the very verge of deception . he added:  around a third of welsh households have been re-valued upwards by at least one band and inevitably face increases into double figures.,politics
193,ask jeeves joins web log market ask jeeves has bought the bloglines website to improve the way it handles content from web journals or blogs.  the bloglines site has become hugely popular as it gives users one place in which to read  search and share all the blogs they are interested in. ask jeeves said it was not planning to change bloglines but would use the 300 million articles it has archived to round out its index of the web. how much ask jeeves paid for bloglines was not revealed.  bloglines has become popular because it lets users build a list of the blogs they want to follow without having to visit each journal site individually. to do this it makes use of a technology known as really simple syndication (rss) that many blogs have adopted to let other sites know when new entries are made on their journals. the acquisition follows similar moves by other search sites. google acquired pyra labs  makers of the blogger software  in 2003. in 2004 msn introduced its own blog system and yahoo has tweaked its technology to do a better job of handling blog entries. jim lanzone  vice president of search properties at ask jeeves in the us  said it did not acquire bloglines just to get a foothold in the blog publishing world. he said ask jeeves was much more interested in helping people find information they were looking for rather than helping them write it.   the universe of readers is vastly larger than the universe of writers   he said. mr lanzone said the acquisition would sit well with ask s my jeeves service which lets people customise their own web experience and build up a personal collection of useful links.  search engines are about discovering information for the first time and rss is the ideal way to keep track of and monitor those sites   he said. it would also help drive information and entries from blogs to the portals that ask jeeves operates. there would be no instant sweeping changes to bloglines  said mr lanzone.  our intent is to take our time to figure out the right business model not to try to monetise it right away   he said. though mr lanzone added that ask jeeves would be helping organise the database of 300m blog entries bloglines holds with its own net indexing technology.  being able to search the blogosphere as one corpus of information will be very useful in its own right   said mr lanzone. rumours about the acquisition were broken by the napsterization weblog which said it got the hint from ask jeeves insiders.,tech
194,german business confidence slides german business confidence fell in february knocking hopes of a speedy recovery in europe s largest economy.  munich-based research institute ifo said that its confidence index fell to 95.5 in february from 97.5 in january  its first decline in three months. the study found that the outlook in both the manufacturing and retail sectors had worsened. observers had been hoping that a more confident business sector would signal that economic activity was picking up.   we re surprised that the ifo index has taken such a knock   said dz bank economist bernd weidensteiner.  the main reason is probably that the domestic economy is still weak  particularly in the retail trade.  economy and labour minister wolfgang clement called the dip in february s ifo confidence figure  a very mild decline . he said that despite the retreat  the index remained at a relatively high level and that he expected  a modest economic upswing  to continue.  germany s economy grew 1.6% last year after shrinking in 2003. however  the economy contracted by 0.2% during the last three months of 2004  mainly due to the reluctance of consumers to spend. latest indications are that growth is still proving elusive and ifo president hans-werner sinn said any improvement in german domestic demand was sluggish. exports had kept things going during the first half of 2004  but demand for exports was then hit as the value of the euro hit record levels making german products less competitive overseas. on top of that  the unemployment rate has been stuck at close to 10% and manufacturing firms  including daimlerchrysler  siemens and volkswagen  have been negotiating with unions over cost cutting measures. analysts said that the ifo figures and germany s continuing problems may delay an interest rate rise by the european central bank. eurozone interest rates are at 2%  but comments from senior officials have recently focused on the threat of inflation  prompting fears that interest rates may rise.,business

199,jamieson issues warning to bigots scotland s justice minister has warned bigoted soccer fans that she wants to hit them  where it hurts most  by banning them from matches.  cathy jamieson said exclusion orders are one of a series of measures being considered in the scottish executive campaign against sectarianism. she praised celtic and rangers for their work in tackling the problem. however  the minister said stopping sectarian abuse associated with old firm matches is a key objective. ms jamieson was speaking ahead of the third round scottish cup clash between the glasgow clubs at parkhead on sunday. the sectarianism long associated with sections of the support from both clubs has become a significant target for the executive. last week ms jamieson and first minister jack mcconnell met supporters  representatives from both clubs to discuss the issue.  they plan to hold an anti-sectarian summit next month with officials from the clubs  church leaders  senior police officers and local authority chiefs among those to be invited. speaking on bbc radio scotland s sunday live programme  ms jamieson described friday s meeting as  very productive  and said putting the squeeze on the bigots would be a key aim. ms jamieson stressed that sectarianism has not been confined to football but it can act as a  trigger  for tensions and violence. clubs have taken action in the past to ban troublesome fans and supporters  groups expressed their desire to ensure that the game is no longer tainted by the problem.  ms jamieson said the executive should have a role in tackling the soccer troublemakers. she said:  we can t get away from the fact that in some instances some of the religious hatred that some people try to associate with football boils over into violence.  that is the kind of thing we want to stop and that s the kind of thing supporters  groups are very clear they don t want to be part of either  and they will work with us to try and deal with that.   ms jamieson praised the police for their action and said:  the police do want to identify whether there are particular individuals who are going over the top and inciting hatred or violence - they will crack down very effectively on them.  we have of course already indicated that we will consider the introduction of banning orders to give additional powers to where there are people who are going over the top  who have made inappropriate behaviour at football matches  to be able to stop them attending the games.  that s the kind of thing that will hit those kind of people where it hurts the most in not allowing them to attend the games   she said. praising celtic and rangers for their efforts  she said:  i don t think there is any doubt that we have seen some positive moves from the clubs.  both rangers and celtic football clubs have been involved in working with the executive to produce  for example  an educational pack for young people.,politics
200,bmw cash to fuel mini production less than four years after the new mini was launched  german car maker bmw has announced £100m of new investment.  some 200 new jobs are to be created at the oxford factory  including modernised machinery and a new body shell production building. the result of the investment could be to raise output to more than 200 000 cars from 2007. the rise  from 189 000 last year  is a response to rapidly-rising demand and could help wipe out waiting lists. before wednesday s announcement  bmw had invested some £280m in mini production.  since its launch during summer 2001  the new mini has gone from strength to strength.  last year  almost one in six cars sold by the bmw group was a mini. the company admits that the success of the brand came despite scepticism from many in the industry.  our decision to produce a new mini was not received well right away   said norbert reithofer  a member of the bmw management board. initially  bmw said it would produce 100 000 mini models a year at its vast cowley factory on the outskirts of oxford  but the target was quickly reached  then raised  time and time again. not everyone is convinced that the boom can continue.  the risk is that after they ve invested massively in the brand  demand tapers off like it did with the new vw beetle   said brad wernle  from automotive news europe.  the price of the car has also gone up. when it was launched  the cheapest mini cost just more than £10 000. these days  buyers will have to fork out almost £11 500 to own a new mini one  or even more for the cooper s which costs up to £17 730. the mini convertible  which was launched last spring  costs up to £15 690 for the top model  and there is even a waiting list. second-hand minis are not cheap either. a mini one bought when the model was launched should still fetch at least £8 000 for the cheapest model  while a used cooper s is likely to be priced from £12 556  according to the-car buying website parker s. the consumers  association which operates with slightly different numbers  yet it confirms that the mini cooper 1.6 depreciates slower than any other car  other than the mercedes benz c180 se and the bmw 1 series 116i se.  the cowley factory  which initially seemed far too large a production plant for just 100 000 minis  is increasingly being put to good use.  there are plans to tear down old buildings and build new ones and there are rumours that a new paint shop could be included in the plans. bmw s mini adventure has made good much of what went wrong during its stewardship of the uk car maker rover which it sold for £10 five years ago to the phoenix consortium. in 1999  when bmw still owned rover  the oxford factory was producing the award-winning rover 75. during that year  3 500 people produced 56 000 cars. last year  in the same factory  almost four times as many vehicles were produced by just 4 500 mini-workers. the mini factory s current output is equally impressive when compared with the main rover factory in longbridge  which in 1999 produced 180 000 rover cars. last year  mg rover  which employs more than 6 000 people  produced just 110 000 cars  though it hopes to land a deal with shanghai automotive industry corporation (saic) that could help double the number of cars produced at longbridge. indeed  mini is not only producing more cars than mg rover does; it remains ahead even when the current sales of land rovers and range rovers (which are made by the former rover unit that bmw sold to ford) are taken into account.,business

202,format wars could  confuse users  technology firms sony  philips  matsushita and samsung are developing a common way to stop people pirating digital music and video.  the firms want to make a system that ensures files play on the hardware they make but also thwarts illegal copying. the move could mean more confusion for consumers already faced by many different  and conflicting  content control systems  experts warned. they say there are no guarantees the system will even prevent piracy.  currently many online stores wrap up downloadable files in an own-brand control system that means they can only be played on a small number of media players. systems that limit what people can do with the files they download are known as digital rights management systems. by setting up the alliance to work on a common control system  the firms said they hope to end this current fragmentation of file formats. in a joint statement the firms said they wanted to let consumers enjoy  appropriately licensed video and music on any device  independent of how they originally obtained that content . the firms hope that it will also make it harder for consumers to make illegal copies of the music  movies and other digital content they have bought. called the marlin joint development association  the alliance will define basic specifications that every device made by the electronics firms will conform to. marlin will be built on technology from rights management firm intertrust as well as an earlier drm system developed by a group known as the coral consortium.  the move is widely seen as a way for the four firms to decide their own destiny on content control systems instead of having to sign up for those being pushed by apple and microsoft. confusingly for consumers  the technology that comes out of the alliance will sit alongside the content control systems of rival firms such as microsoft and apple.  in many ways the different drm systems are akin to the different physical formats  such as betamax and vhs  that consumers have seen in the past   said ian fogg  personal technology and broadband analyst at jupiter research.  the difference is that it is very fragmented   he said.  it s not a two-horse race  it s a five  six  seven or even eight-horse race  mr fogg said consumers had to be very careful when buying digital content to ensure that it would play on the devices they own. he said currently there were even incompatibilities within drm families. although initiatives such as microsoft s  plays for sure  program could help remove some of the uncertainty  he said  life was likely to be confusing for consumers for some time to come.  shelley taylor  analyst and author of a report about online music services  said the locks and limits on digital files were done to maximise the cash that firms can make from consumers. apple s itunes service was a perfect example of this  she said.  although itunes has been hugely successful  apple could not justify its existence if it did not help sell all those ipods   she said.  she said rampant competition between online music services  of which there are now 230 according to recent figures  could drive more openness and freer file formats.  it always works out that consumer needs win out in the long run   she said   and the services that win in the long run are the ones that listen to consumers earliest.  ms taylor said the limits legal download services place on files could help explain the continuing popularity of file-sharing systems that let people get hold of pirated pop.  people want portability   she said   and with peer-to-peer they have 100% portability.  cory doctorow  european co-ordinator for the electronic frontier foundation which campaigns for consumers on many cyber-rights issues  expressed doubts that the marlin system would achieve its aims.  not one of these systems has ever prevented piracy or illegal copying   he said. he said many firms readily admit that their drm systems are little protection against skilled attackers such as the organised crime gangs that are responsible for most piracy. instead  said mr doctorow  drm systems were intended to control the group that electronics firms have most hold over - consumers.  the studios and labels perceive an opportunity to sell you your media again and again - the ipod version  the auto version  the american and uk version  the ringtone version  and so on.,tech

213,freeze on anti-spam campaign a campaign by lycos europe to target spam-related websites appears to have been put on hold.  earlier this week the company released a screensaver that bombarded the sites with data to try to bump up the running costs of the websites. but the site hosting the screensaver now displays a pink graphic and the words  stay tuned . no one at lycos was available for comment on latest developments in its controversial anti-spam campaign.  lycos europe s  make love not spam  campaign was intended as a way for users to fight back against the mountain of junk mail flooding inboxes. people were encouraged to download the screensaver which  when their pc was idle  would then send lots of data to sites that peddle the goods and services mentioned in spam messages. lycos said the idea was to get the spam sites running at 95% capacity and generate big bandwidth bills for the spammers behind the sites. but the plan has proved controversial.  monitoring firm netcraft analysed response times for some of the sites targeted by the screensaver and found that a number were completely knocked offline.  the downing of the sites could dent lycos claims that what it is doing does not amount to a distributed denial of service attack. in such attacks thousands of computers bombard sites with data in an attempt to overwhelm them. laws in many countries do not explicitly outlaw such attacks but many nations are re-drafting computer use laws to make them specific offences. lycos europe now appears to have put the plan on hold. the site hosting the screensaver currently shows a holding page  with the words   stay tuned . the numerical internet address of the site has also changed. this is likely to be in response to spammers who have reportedly redirected traffic from their sites back to the lycos screensaver site. the campaign has come under fire from some corners of the web. many discussion groups have said that it set a dangerous precedent and could incite vigilantism.  attacking a spammer s website is like poking a grizzly bear sleeping in your back garden with a pointy stick   said graham cluley  senior technology consultant for sophos.  not only is this screensaver similar in its approach to a potentially illegal distributed denial of service attack  but it also is in danger of turning innocent computer users into vigilantes  who may not be prepared for whatever retaliation the spammers care to dream up.,tech
214,china suspends 26 power projects china has ordered a halt to construction work on 26 big power stations  including two at the three gorges dam  on environmental grounds.  the move is a surprising one because china is struggling to increase energy supplies for its booming economy. last year 24 provinces suffered black outs. the state environmental protection agency said the 26 projects had failed to do proper environmental assessments. topping the list was a controversial dam on the scenic upper yangtze river.  construction of these projects has started without approval of the assessment of their environmental impact... they are typical illegal projects of construction first  approval next   said sepa vice-director pan yue  in a statement on the agency s website.  some of the projects may be allowed to start work again with the proper permits  but others would be cancelled  he said. altogether  the agency ordered 30 projects halted. other projects included a petrochemicals plant and a port in fujian. the bulk of the list was made up of new power plants  with some extensions to existing ones. the stoppages would appear to be another step in the central government s battle to control projects licensed by local officials. however  previous crackdowns have tended to focus on projects for which the government argued there was overcapacity  such as steel and cement. the government has encouraged construction of new electricity generating capacity to solve chronic energy shortages which forced many factories onto part-time working last year. in 2004  china increased its generating capacity by 12.6%  or 440 700 megawatts (mw). the biggest single project to be halted was the xiluodi dam project  designed to produce 12 600 mw of electricity. it is being built on the jinshajiang - or  river of golden sand  as the upper reaches of the yangtze are known. second and third on the agency s list were two power stations being built at the $22bn three gorges dam project on the central yangtze - an underground 4 200 mw power plant and a 100 mw plant.  the three gorges dam has proved controversial in china - where more than half a million people have been relocated to make way for it - and abroad. it has drawn criticism from environmental groups and overseas human rights activists. the damming of the upper yangtze has also begun to attract criticism from environmentalists in china. in april 2004  central government officials ordered a halt to work on the nearby nu river  which is part of a united nations world heritage site  the three parallel rivers site which covers the yangtze  mekong and nu (also known as the salween)  according to the uk-published china review. that move reportedly followed a protest from the thai government about the downstream impact of the dams  and a critical documentary made by chinese journalists. china s energy shortage influenced global prices for oil  coal and shipping last year.,business

216,microsoft plans  safer id  system microsoft is planning to make windows and internet explorer more secure by including software to give people more control over personal information.   info cards  will help people manage personal details on their pcs to make online services safer  said microsoft. microsoft s two previous programs  passport and hailstorm  aimed to protect users but were criticised. id fraud is one of the uk s fastest-growing crimes  with criminals netting an estimated £1.3bn last year. a quarter of uk adults has either had their id stolen  via hi-tech or other means  or knows someone who has  a recent report by which  magazine found.  microsoft is developing a new version of internet explorer browser and its operating system  windows  which has been code-named longhorn. michael stephenson  director in microsoft s windows server division  would not confirm however whether the new info cards id system will be built into the current windows xp version or longhorn.   we re trying to make the end-user experience as simple as possible   mr stephenson said. the system would differ from its previous attempts to make online transactions more secure  said microsoft. while passport and hailstorm stored user information centrally on the net  the latest system will store data on a user s pc.  it s going to put control of digital ids into the hands of an end-user  the end-user will be in full control   said mr stephenson.  hailstorm was criticised by privacy campaigners for putting too much sensitive information into the hands of a single company. passport provides a single log-in for more than one website and stores basic personal information. but its popularity suffered after security scares. up to 200 million passport accounts were left vulnerable to online theft and malicious hackers after a flaw in the system was exploited in 2003. online auction site  ebay  stopped supporting it in january 2005. although the flaw was fixed  microsoft has come under regular criticism for the number of security loopholes in internet explorer. last year  it released a major security update for windows  service pack 2  to combat some of the security concerns. longhorn is due to be released commercially in late 2006  but an updated version of internet explorer is due for release later this year.,tech

219,anti-terror plan faces first test plans to allow home secretary charles clarke to place terror suspects under house arrest without trial are set for their first real test in parliament.  tories  lib dems and some labour mps are poised to vote against the plans. mr clarke says the powers are needed to counter terror threats. opponents say only judges  not politicians  should be able to order detention of uk citizens. the government is expected to win wednesday s vote in the commons  but faces a battle in the house of lords.  the prevention of terrorism bill was published on tuesday. it proposes  control orders   which would mean house arrest in the most serious cases  and curfews  electronic tagging and limits on telephone and internet access for other suspects.  the two opposition parties are particularly worried that the control orders would initially be imposed on the say-so of the home secretary  rather than a judge. tory shadow home secretary david davis warned of the potential for miscarriages of justice  like the guildford four - for which tony blair recently apologised - as a result of the pressure on politicians to lock up terror suspects.  those pressures would be much more for a politician than they would on a judge and that s why we have serious concerns abut that approach   he told bbc radio 4 s today programme.  mr clarke says he does not intend to use the house arrest powers now - even for the 11 current terror detainees. he also said that any decision he made would be reviewed by a judge within seven days. the foreign terror suspects currently detained are mostly held at london s belmarsh prison. they are held under laws which the law lords have ruled break human rights rules - and which are due to expire on 14 march.  the new powers  designed to replace the existing laws and meet the law lords  concerns  would apply to british as well as foreign terror suspects. critics say that giving politicians the power to deprive uk citizens of their freedom is the biggest attack on civil liberties for 300 years. opposition mps are also angry they will have only two days - wednesday and next monday - to debate the new plans before they pass to the house of lords. but the government says the existing powers run out soon so must be replaced urgently.  in a rare move  the tories and lib dems have jointly tabled a motion opposing the new bill  saying the house arrest plans are  excessive . it argues decisions should be taken on a higher standard of proof and the plan  wrongly infringes the right to liberty  by failing to bring terrorists to trial where there is evidence. mr davis told today:  it gives a minister  for the first time in modern history  the right to detain without trial  without showing the evidence and indeed  in some respects  almost the allegation against the individual concerned.   he questioned why there was  such a rush  to introduce the legislation when mr clarke had indicated he was not planning to use the house arrest powers straight away. liberal democrat home affairs spokesman mark oaten said:  we believe it should be the judge that takes decisions  not politicians.  mr clarke said the security services and police backed his measures and it would be  rash and negligent  to ignore their advice. nobody should doubt that terrorists at home and abroad wanted to attack the uk and its interests  he argued.,politics

227,musicians  upbeat  about the net musicians are embracing the internet as a way of reaching new fans and selling more music  a survey has found.  the study by us researchers  pew internet  suggests musicians do not agree with the tactics adopted by the music industry against file-sharing. while most considered file-sharing as illegal  many disagreed with the lawsuits launched against downloaders.  even successful artists don t think the lawsuits will benefit musicians   said report author mary madden.  for part of the study  pew internet conducted an online survey of 2 755 musicians  songwriters and music publishers via musician membership organisations between march and april 2004.  they ranged from full-time  successful musicians to artists struggling to make a living from their music.  we looked at more of the independent musicians  rather than the rockstars of this industry but that reflects more accurately the state of the music industry   ms madden told the bbc news website.  we always hear the views of successful artists like the britneys of the world but the less successful artists rarely get represented.  the survey found that musicians were overwhelming positive about the internet  rather than seeing it as just a threat to their livelihood. almost all of them used the net for ideas and inspiration  with nine out of 10 going online to promote  advertise and post their music on the web. more than 80% offered free samples online  while two-thirds sold their music via the net. independent musicians  in particular  saw the internet as a way to get around the need to land a record contract and reach fans directly.  musicians are embracing the internet enthusiastically   said ms madden.  they are using the internet to gain inspiration  sell it online  tracking royalties  learning about copyright.   perhaps surprisingly  opinions about online file-sharing were diverse and not as clear cut as those of the record industry.  through the recording industry association of america (riaa)  it has pursued an aggressive campaign through the courts to sue people suspected of sharing copyrighted music. but the report suggests this campaign does not have the wholehearted backing of musicians in the us. it found that most artists saw file-sharing as both good and bad  though most agreed that it should be illegal.  free downloading has killed opportunities for new bands to break without major funding and backing   said one musician quoted by the report.  it s hard to keep making records if they don t pay for themselves through sales.  however 60% said they did not think the lawsuits against song swappers would benefit musicians and songwriters. many suggested that rather than fighting file-sharing  the music industry needed to recognise the changes it has brought and embrace it.  both successful and struggling musicians were more likely to say that the internet has made it possible for them to make more money from their music  rather than make it harder for them to protect their material from piracy   said ms madden.,tech

229,jones files lawsuit against conte marion jones has filed a lawsuit for defamation against balco boss victor conte following his allegations that he gave her performance-enhancing drugs.  the sydney olympic gold medallist says conte damaged her reputation and she is seeking $25m (£13m) in the suit. conte  whose company is at the centre of a doping investigation  made the claims in a us television programme. he and three others were indicted in february by a federal grand jury for a variety of alleged offences. in an email to the associated press on wednesday  conte said:  i stand by everything i said . jones won three gold medals and two bronzes in sydney in 2000. her lawsuit  filed in the us district court in san francisco  said the sprinter had passed a lie detector test and that she  has never taken banned performance-enhancing drugs . conte s statements  the suit added  were  false and malicious . after the abc television program earlier this month  jones  lawyer richard nicholls said:  marion has steadfastly maintained her position throughout: she has never  ever used performance-enhancing drugs.  victor conte is a man facing a 42-count federal indictment  while marion jones is one of america s most decorated female athletes. mr conte s statements have been wildly contradictory.  mr conte chose to make unsubstantiated allegations on television  while marion jones demanded to take and then passed a lie detector examination.   mr conte is simply not credible. we challenge him to submit to the same lie detector procedure that marion jones passed.  the sport s ruling body  the iaaf  is taking a cautious approach to conte s allegations but contacted the us anti-doping agency. communications director nick davies said the iaaf would seek to contact conte  for further information . but davies stressed it would be up to the american authorities to decide whether they will take action against jones in light of conte s television interview and the world governing body would monitor the situation closely.  if it is felt there is case to answer  it would be for its national governing body (usa track and field) to take the appropriate disciplinary action   he added.  the us anti-doping agency has proved itself to be very diligent in its anti-doping war.  and i am sure  like ourselves  they will be watching the television programme with great interest.  jones  who is under investigation for steroid use by the us anti-doping agency  has continually denied ever taking illegal substances since being investigated in the balco scandal  although she praised a zinc supplement conte marketed. jones  who did not win any medals in athens in august  has never failed a drugs test. meanwhile  conte  who has been charged along with three other men of distributing illegal steroids and money laundering  is due to face trial in march.,sport

231,what really divides the parties so what is the gap between labour and the tories nowadays   one starbucks  one rymans and one small greek cafe as it happens. both parties have now completed their moves to new headquarters  with labour creating its election hub just three doors away from the tories  new headquarters in victoria street  just down the road from the commons. that should make things a little easier if and when the crack-of-dawn election press conferences kick off. unlike 2001  there should be no need for colleagues to have taxis gunning their engines outside  or to buy scooters  to get themselves between the tightly-timetabled events.  and  to all intents and purposes  we already appear to be in that general election campaign. certainly the press conference hosted by election co-ordinator alan milburn  in the rather compact new conference room - still smelling of new carpet and with the garish new labour coffee mugs as yet unstained - had all the hallmarks of an election event.   welcome to the unremittingly new labour media centre   he said. and i ll bet he hadn t checked that one with gordon brown. along with work and pensions secretary alan johnson and minister for work jane kennedy  he then went on to tear into the tory plans to scrap the new deal welfare-to-work scheme  which they claimed would lead to an increase of almost 300 000 in unemployment. and they ridiculed the claims made on monday by michael howard that he could save £35 billion of labour waste and inefficiency to spend on public services while also offering £4 billion of tax cuts. labour has come up with a figure of £22 billions worth of efficiency savings so  understandably perhaps  believe mr howard must be planning cuts to squeeze the extra £13 billion. these figures  based on the two parties  own detailed studies  will be battered to within an inch of their lives during the campaign. wednesday was just the start.,politics
232,tories attack eu asylum moves david blunkett has been accused of using the  politics of confusion  to disguise new eu immigration measures.  tory spokesman david davis told mps the uk was losing its power of veto over who was allowed to come to britain. the eu has opted to adopt qualified majority voting in this area - previously measures needed unanimous agreement from all member states. mr blunkett told mps the uk would still be able to reject proposals on immigration it did not agree with.  he argued closer co-operation with europe over asylum and immigration was crucial to controlling the flow of people into the uk.  if we don t like what other eu countries do on immigration and nationality we have the right to opt-in or out to suit the british people   he said. the home secretary was responding to an emergency question from his tory opposite number mr davis.  the government is employing the politics of confusion - i think  deliberately   argued mr davis.  by confusing the country it hopes no one will notice the disappearance of the asylum and immigration veto.  on monday tony blair insisted closer co-operation did not mean losing control of british borders. he said an enlarged 25-member eu needs a streamlined decision making process. mr davis said once britain had opted into policies then it could not opt out - leaving the uk open to unfavourable interpretations of what those policies actually meant.  he accused the government of being  pathetic  when it came to its efforts over immigration and asylum and of  surrendering  on the issue. and he asked why the government was agreeing to the measure on asylum and immigration now when the whole issue was part of the eu constitution  which voters in the uk had been promised a referendum over. mr blair told his monthly news conference britain had the  best of both worlds  and would keep the veto.  there is no question of britain giving up our veto on our border controls   he said.  with the treaty of amsterdam seven years ago  we secured the absolute right to opt in to any of the asylum and immigration provisions that we wanted to in europe.  mr blunkett met his eu counterparts in luxembourg on monday to consider proposals aimed at streamlining decision making on the issue.  the 25 member-states are expected to scrap the requirement for unanimous agreement on immigration policy  in favour of the qualified majority voting (qmv) system. under this scheme larger states such as britain are expected to have more power than the smaller eu states. britain is expected to retain an  opt-in  right which will allow it to ignore any measures it disagrees with. liberal democrat spokesman mark oaten called the change pragmatic and argued it gave a better chance of producing a european asylum solution.  if we don t work together it means some countries can ignore their responsibilities at the expense of their neighbours   said mr oaten.  the liberal democrats have long argued that britain should be a safe haven for asylum seekers but it s right that we don t do this in isolation.,politics
233,nintendo ds aims to touch gamers the mobile gaming industry is set to explode in 2005 with a number of high-profile devices offering a range of gaming and other features such as movie and music playback. market leader nintendo  however  is releasing a handheld console that it says will revolutionise the way games are played.  the first striking thing about the ds is how retro it looks. far from looking like a mould-breaking handheld  it looks more like nintendo dug out a mould from a 1980s handheld prototype. the lightweight clam shell device opens up to reveal two screens  and when switched on it instantly reveals its pedigree. both screens are crisp and clear while the bottom of the two is touch sensitive. nintendo has given developers free rein to utilise the dual screens and ability to control the action by simply touching the screen.  the japanese gaming giant hopes the ds will maintain the firm s pre-eminence in an increasingly-competitive mobile gaming market.  nintendo first launched its gameboy console in 1989 and has dominated the market ever since. but its lead can no longer be taken for granted. sony will enter the market later this year with its playstation portable  while start-up companies gizmondo and tapwave zodiac are also offering hybrid devices.  we believe the ds will appeal to all ages  both genders and gamers of any skill   said david yarnton  nintendo europe s general manager said at the recent press launch for the handheld. with its two screens  wireless connectivity and backwards compatibility with the gameboy advance  the ds certainly has a number of unique selling points. it went on sale in the us in mid-november priced $150 and nintendo says sales have exceeded expectations  without giving detailed figures. japan and europe will have to wait until the first quarter of 2005 to get the device. with more than two million pre-orders for the device in japan  nintendo is confident it will keep its number one spot. but will the device prove to be as revolutionary as claimed  the game ships with a demo of metroid hunters - a 3d action title which can be played alone or with a group of friends using the machine s wireless capabilities. it certainly looks impressive on the small machine and plays smoothly even with a group of people.  the game can be controlled by using the supplied stylus to aim. the top screen is used to navigate the action while the bottom screen offers a top-down map and the ability to switch weapons. it is certainly a unique control method and while it makes aiming more controlled it can be a little disorientating. super mario 64 ds is a faithful re-creation of the nintendo 64 classic with a host of new mini-games and new levels. the game looks stunning on the portable machine and the sound too is impressive for such a small machine. one thing is for certain. hardened gamers will have to learn to adapt to a new way of playing while it could prove to be an accessible way in to gaming for novices  ultimately the success or failure of the device lies in the hands of developers. if they manage to create titles which use the nintendo ds s key features then a whole new market of gamers could open up. the fear is that the touch screen and voice recognition are treated as little more than gimmicks.,tech
234,bid to cut court witness stress new targets to reduce the stress to victims and witnesses giving evidence in courts in england and wales have been announced by the lord chancellor.  lord falconer wants all crown courts and 90% of magistrates  courts to have facilities to keep witnesses separate from defendants within four years. more video links will also be made available so that witnesses do not have to enter courtrooms. it is part of a five-year plan to help build confidence in the justice system.  ministers say the strategy is aimed at re-balancing the court system towards victims  and increasing the number of offenders brought to justice. launching the department for constitutional affairs  plan  lord falconer said:  one of the top priorities will be a better deal for victims.  the needs and safety of victims will be at the heart of the way trials are managed.   courts  judges  magistrates  prosecutors  police and victim support - all working together to ensure the rights of victims are put first  without compromising the rights of the defendant.  he went on:  giving evidence is a nerve-wracking experience  especially when you re a victim.  yet with a will and with support it can be done.  lord falconer told bbc radio 4 s today programme it was impossible for some elderly people to go to court to give evidence. other witnesses could be intimidated by sitting alongside defendants outside courts.  you are never going to get rid of some element of the trauma of giving evidence   he said.  but you can make people believe that the courts understand the problem  it s not some kind of alien place where they go where they are not thinking about them.   the plan comes as the lord chancellor also considers allowing cameras into courts for the first time since 1925  as long as they were used for cases that did not involve witnesses. another feature of the strategy is constitutional reform  with a government bill to set up a supreme court and a judicial appointments commission returning to the house of lords on tuesday. ministers had proposed getting rid of the title of lord chancellor  but the lords have over-ruled this. lord falconer said it was right for the highest court to be completely distinct from parliament. the person in charge of the court system should not also be speaker of the house of lords  he said  and should be the best person chosen from either house of parliament. what they did  not what they were called  was the critical issue  he added.,politics
235,nuclear body seeks new tech the computer systems used to monitor the world s nuclear power installations are so outdated that they are hampering the work of inspectors.  a spokesman for the international atomic energy agency (iaea) said its current technology could allow key information to be overlooked as it was more than 20 years old. such systems are the only method of tracking nuclear material worldwide. the agency has appealed for more funds to update its hardware and software.  a major overhaul of the system is needed to allow inspectors immediate  secure online access to information   said project manager livio costantini.  iaea inspectors make around 3 000 visits a year to more than 900 nuclear facilities worldwide. they are there to verify official reports of activities in the plants  to carry out environmental checks  and also to look for any signs that nuclear material is being smuggled in or out of the facility.  the computer system inspectors currently use for comparing data from earlier visits  for instance  was built in the 1970s and largely paper based. an iaea spokesman said this was extremely inefficient and makes searching for anomalies like searching for a needle in a haystack. the organisation is aiming to start a system upgrade in november  aiming to provide inspectors in the field with secure online access to previous inspection data  design blueprints of nuclear facilities  even satellite images of the plant. where possible  it hopes to link the system with national records of the import and export of nuclear materials. further analysis of these could help spot potential smuggling activities or illicit technology transfers between countries  according to a spokesman.  computer specialist at the iaea  peter smith  would like to be able to incorporate state of the art visualisation techniques  more familiar to video games players  into the inspector s toolkit.  the commercials you now see have people are moving around in a virtual world   he said.  if we could have that on our laptops  we could be walking through the plant seeing  on the laptop  how the plant should look.  and if there s a door in the wall that is not on our laptop  then we have a problem.  the iaea estimates the total cost of the four-year project to upgrade its technology will be $40m. so far it has only received $11m from the us and the uk.  failure to replace the hardware and software  and to integrate fully all the information system components will carry large risks   said an agency statement.,tech

238,mac mini heralds mini revolution the mac mini was launched amid much fanfare by apple and great excitement by apple watchers last month. but does the latest macintosh justify the hype  let us get a few things dealt with at the outset - yes  the mac mini is really  really small  and yes  it is another piece of inspired apple design. there is more to be said on the computer s size and design but it is worth highlighting that the mac mini is a just a computer. inside that small box there is a g4 processor  a cd/dvd player  a hard drive  some other technical bits and bobs and an operating system. a dvd burner  wireless and bluetooth technologies can be bought at extra cost. and if you do not have a monitor  keyboard or mouse then you will need to purchase those also.  it is not the fastest computer for the money but for under £400 you are getting something more interesting than mere technical specifications - apple software. the mac mini comes bundled with mac os x  the operating system  as well as ilife 05  a suite of software which includes itunes  web browser safari  iphoto  garage band and idvd. i doubt many pc lovers would seriously argue that windows xp comes with a better suite of programs than mac os x.  of course  users of open source operating system linux draw up their own menu of programs. for people who want to do interesting things with their music  photos and home movies then a mac mini is an ideal first computer or companion to a main computer.  it s a good little machine with a reasonable amount of power and just perfect for the average computer user who wants to leave the tyranny of window and viruses   said mark sparrow  technical and reviews editor at mac format magazine. he added:  in essence  it s a laptop in a biscuit tin  minus the screen and the keyboard.  the software bundle that comes with the mini makes your average budget pc look a bit sick.  the relatively low price of the machine has also encouraged the more technically-savvy to experiment with their macs. one user has already created a  dock  to enable him to plug in and out his mac mini in his car.  the small size of the machine makes it a practical solution for in-car entertainment - playing movies and music - as well as navigation. another user has mounted his mac mini to the back of his large plasma screen and then controls the computer via a wireless keyboard and mouse. when it was first announced some pundits thought the mini was designed as a sort of stealth media centre - ie the machine would be used to serve tv programmes  music  films and photos - partly due to its small  living room friendly design. but there are obvious reasons why this is not the case - at least not in the here and now the hard drive - at 80gb for the larger model - is too small to be realistically used as media centre.  while commercial personal video recorders are on the market with smaller than 80gb hard drives it is worth remembering that they only store tv content. a media centre computer has to store music  files and photos and as such 80gb just seems too small. most pcs running windows media center have at least 120gb hard disks. coupled with the lack of a tv tuner card  a digital audio out and any kind of media centre software bundled with the machine then the mac mini should be judged on what it is  not what it is not. but that has not stopped more enterprising users from adapting the mac mini to media centre uses. so - is the mac mini just another computer or a revolution in computing  graham barlow  editor of mac format  understandably has a rather partisan viewpoint.  it s just a mac  but we should be very excited - it s revolutionary in its size (smaller than pcs)  looks (looks better than pcs)  and the fact that it s the first mac designed to really go for the low-cost pc market.  the design of the mac mini is further evidence of a future when pcs are more than just bland  bulky boxes. there are a number of companies who already produce miniature pcs based on mini-itx motherboards. but at the moment these pcs tend to be either for the home-build enthusiast or expensive pre-built options based around microsoft s media center software. but for the value the mac mini offers  bringing some of the best software packages within reach of more consumers than ever before  apple is to be congratulated. let us say then that if the mac mini is not a fully fledged revolution - it is a mini revolution.,tech
239,correction agency plans dropped plans to create a single correctional agency for scotland have been scrapped.  the scottish executive will not now merge the scottish prison service with local authority social work criminal justice departments. the national correctional agency would have provided a  one-stop  justice system but has been abandoned in the wake of stiff opposition. instead  scottish councils and the prison service will be compelled to work more closely to cut reoffending. the plan was to ensure offenders were monitored by the same body during and after prison  preventing many from being lost in the system and helping more of them to stop reoffending.  scotland s reoffending rate is high  with more than 60% of prisoners reconvicted within two years of release from jail. this is leading to an ever-expanding prison population and the executive wants to tackle the problem. ministers thought merging the prison service with the council-controlled criminal justice social work departments  which provide community sentences  might have provided an answer. however  following a consultation on the idea  justice minister cathy jamieson has decided to drop the plans. instead  ms jamieson will change the law to help produce a closer working relationship between both elements of the justice system.  she will announce the move in her criminal justice plan on monday  aiming to  break down the barriers between what happens in prison and what happens in the community . the new measures will place a new statutory duty on the sps to work with local authorities and others in area partnerships. a national advisory board on offender management will also be created to advise ms jamieson on the sps s role and performance in reducing reoffending. the minister said:  better joint working will help prisons play a much stronger role in ending reoffending behaviour and in particular help address the revolving door of reoffending that sees offenders entering prison for short periods during which little is done to address the behaviour that brought them there.  communities who are paying the price for this reoffending - both in terms of crime and in terms of prison costs - expect better.  it costs the taxpayer £35 000 a year to provide each prison place and that cost is increasing.  taxpayers who suffer the consequences of crime also end up paying for keeping those people in prison.  therefore  as we continue to invest in the service  it is only right that we seek to ensure that that service becomes more accountable to the public it serves  to ministers and to parliament.,politics
240,top of the pops leaves bbc one the bbc s flagship pop music programme top of the pops is to move from bbc one on fridays to sundays on bbc two.  the new programme will combine with archive show totp2  mixing new music with footage of classic bands. the corporation said the new show  aims to appeal to a diverse audience of music lovers . the move is the biggest shake-up in the history of the show  which was first broadcast in 1964 and has always been on bbc one. top of the pops was relaunched in a blaze of publicity in december last year in an attempt to reverse a long-term decline in audience figures.  the all new top of the pops was fronted by newcomer tim kash and was put together by producer andi peters  who was brought back to the bbc from channel 4 to revitalise the series.  about three million people a week were watching the show on fridays - less than half the total it was attracting in the mid-1990s - as the programme went up against popular itv soap coronation street. but despite the relaunch audience figures failed to rise and still remain around the three million mark. tim kash has since been replaced as host by fearne cotton. the new show will launch in spring next year in an extended format. bbc two controller roly keating:  it s an exciting new era for top of the pops. we want to make it bigger and better so that it becomes the ultimate pop music show for music lovers of every generation.  mr keating described bbc two as the  natural home  of top of the pops. he added:  the addition of top of the pops will also extend bbc two s offering to younger audiences.   a bbc spokeswoman said andi peters would continue as executive producer on the show. she said that issues over the exact format of the programme and a time slot were still to be decided. the programme will have a close relationship with the bbc radio 1 chart show  which suggests the relaunched show may be transmitted at about 1900 on sundays.  hopefully the audience for top of the pops will find it on bbc two.  we think that the new slot will create a buzz around the programme as for the first time viewers will discover the news of who is number one as it happens.,entertainment

242,chelsea denied by james heroics a brave defensive display  led by keeper david james  helped manchester city hold the leaders chelsea.  after a quiet opening  james denied damien duff  jiri jarosik and mateja kezman  while paul bosvelt cleared william gallas  header off the line. robbie fowler should have scored for the visitors but sent his header wide. chelsea had most of the possession in the second half but james kept out frank lampard s free-kick and superbly tipped the same player s volley wide. city went into the game with the proud record of being the only domestic team to beat chelsea this season. and there was little to alarm them in the first 30 minutes as chelsea - deprived of arjen robben and didier drogba through injury - struggled to pose much of a threat. indeed  it was the visitors who looked likelier to enliven a drab opening played at a lethargic pace. shaun wright-phillips - watched by england boss sven-goran eriksson - showed his customary trickery to burst into the right of the area and deliver a dangerous ball  which was blocked by john terry. but chelsea suddenly stepped up a gear and created a flurry of chances. first  duff got round ben thatcher and blasted in a shot that james parried to kezman  who turned the ball wide.  soon afterwards  jarosik found space in the area to powerfully head lampard s corner goalwards but james tipped the ball over. chelsea were now looking more like premiership leaders and james kept out kezman s fierce drive before bosvelt and james combined to clear gallas  header from duff s corner. city broke swiftly up the field and the last chance of a frenetic spell should have resulted in fowler celebrating his 150th premiership goal. wright-phillips raced down the left and crossed to fowler but city s lone man up front  left free by terry s slip  contrived to head wide when it seemed a breakthrough was certain. the second half started as quietly as the first  although james was forced to divert a cross from the lively duff away from eidur gudjohnsen s path. there was a nasty moment for petr cech  looking for a ninth straight clean sheet in the league  when a series of ricochets saw fowler chase a loose ball in the area and collide accidently with the czech republic stopper. another quiet spell followed  which duff interrupted with a surging run that was halted illegally on the edge of the penalty area by bosvelt. lampard stepped up to blast a shot through the wall and james somehow blocked it with his legs. another timely challenge  this time from richard dunne in time added on  prevented gudjohnsen from getting in a shot. there was still time for james to produce a sensational save to tip lampard s volley round the post.  cech  paulo ferreira  gallas  terry  bridge  jarosik (tiago 56)  lampard  makelele  duff  gudjohnsen  kezman (cole 63).  subs not used: johnson  smertin  cudicini.  makelele  gudjohnsen.  james  mills  distin  dunne  thatcher  shaun wright-phillips  bosvelt  barton  sibierski (mcmanaman 85)  musampa  fowler.  subs not used: macken  weaver  onuoha  jordan.  bosvelt.  42 093  h webb (s yorkshire).,sport
243,holmes urged to compete at worlds jolanda ceplak has urged britain s kelly holmes to continue competing at the major championships.  double olympic gold medallist holmes has strongly hinted she will not run in this year s worlds and is undecided about next month s european indoors. but world indoor 800m record holder ceplak said:  there is never an easy race when she is in the field. there is only excitement at what might happen.  it is good for the sport. she always fetches the best out of everyone.  ceplak has been a great rival of holmes  during the briton s career and the pair fell out when holmes questioned the manner of the slovenian s runaway 800m victory at the 2002 european championships. but the controversy has since been forgotten  with ceplak acting as pacemaker for holmes  failed attempt on the british indoor 1500m record at the norwich union grand prix in birmingham in 2003.  ceplak added:  i like running against her - you know the race is always going to be fast.  that is the sort of competition that i like. she is special to me. she was like my idol from the beginning of my career.  meanwhile  ceplak will be looking to follow up last saturday s win in boston with a fast time and victory in friday s night of athletics in erfurt  germany. britain s jason gardener had been expected to defend his 60m title in erfurt but instead he will save himself for a competition in leipzig on sunday. gardener s decision means scotland s 400m man ian mackie will carry british hopes in what looks sure to be a tough preparation for next weekend s norwich union european trials in sheffield.,sport
244,healey targets england comeback leicester wing austin healey hopes to use sunday s return heineken cup clash with wasps as a further springboard to an england recall for the six nations.  healey  who won 51 caps prior to the 2003 world cup  has been in good form in the tigers  resurgence this season.  i definitely still have ambitions to play for england   healey told the bbc.  we will have to see what happens after the previous (autumn) tests but when i look at the current squad i definitely feel there is a place there for me.  healey  who has also played both half-back positions and full-back during his career  has reverted to the wing  where he won most of his england caps. after recovering from a trapped nerve in his back sustained at the end of september  the 31-year-old is relishing his role in the tigers revival.  i had six weeks out but fortunately i have resumed the sort of form i had before   he said.   i am basically playing where it best suits leicester. obviously i can play scrum-half  fly-half or full-back at a moment s notice.  but playing on the wing actually gives me a bigger free role to come in where i am not expected and influence things.  that has been apparent in parts one and two of the wasps-leicester trilogy in recent weeks. first  healey came off his flank with an angled run to score an injury-time try that earned the tigers a 17-17 draw in their premiership meeting on 21 november. then  in the first of their heineken cup double header last sunday  healey slotted in at stand-off and delivered a superb cross-kick for martin corry to score the tigers  third try.  i caught  cozza s  eye a couple of phases before that and was hoping to get it to him on the full  but fortunately even with the bounce he managed to score   healey recalled.  healey  twice a heineken cup winner  believes last sunday s match was  up there  with some of the biggest club contests he has played in.  it was a very intense occasion and a very destructive game   he recalled.  there was not a huge amount of rugby played but it was a great game to be involved in.  after about 15 minutes i thought we might stride away with it but wasps really came back into it and in the last couple of minutes it could have gone either way.   the same outcome this sunday would put leicester in pole position to top their heineken pool with a home game against biarritz and away trip to calvisano to come. but healey insists the tigers must summon the same desire if they are to deliver the knockout blow in what has been dubbed  rugby s version of rocky ii .  there was a lot of satisfaction in the dressing room aftewards but it is really only a case of a job half done   he added.  it was the first of a two-leg trip and if we lose at welford road it will negate all the positives we can take from result.  i think it came down to who wanted it more and in the end i think we did. we have got to show the same desire again this week.,sport
245,new consoles promise big problems making games for future consoles will require more graphic artists and more money  an industry conference has been told.  sony  microsoft and nintendo will debut their new consoles at the annual e3 games expo in los angeles in may. these so-called  next generation  machines will be faster than current consoles  and capable of displaying much higher-quality visuals. for gamers  this should make for better  more immersive games. in a pre-recorded video slot during microsoft s keynote address at the game developers conference  held last week in san francisco  famed director james cameron revealed he is making a game in tandem with his next film - believed to be battle angel alita. the game s visual quality would be  like a lucid dream   said mr cameron. but numerous speakers warned that creating such graphics will require more artists  and so next generation console games will be much more expensive to develop. the first new console  microsoft s xbox 2  is not expected to reach the shops until the end of 2005. games typically take at least 18 months to create  however  so developers are grappling with the hardware today.  according to robert walsh  head of brisbane-based game developer krome studios  next generation games will cost between $10-25m to make  with teams averaging 80 staff in size taking two years to complete a title. such sums mean it will be difficult for anyone to start a new game studio  said mr walsh.  if you re a start-up  i doubt that a publisher is going to walk in and give you a cheque for $10m  however good you are   he said. mr walsh suggested that new studios should make games for mobile phones and handheld consoles like the sony psp and the nintendo ds  since they are cheaper and easier to create than console games.  one developer bucking the trend towards big art teams is will wright  the creator of the best-selling the sims games. the founder of california s maxis studio surprised the conference with a world exclusive preview of his next game  spore. spore will allow players to experiment with the evolution of digital creatures. starting with an amoeba-sized organism  the player will guide the physical development of their creature by selecting how its limbs  jaws and other body parts evolve.  eventually the creature will become capable of establishing cities  trading and fighting  and even building space ships. advanced players will visit the home planets of creatures created by other spore players. these worlds will be automatically swapped across the internet. mr wright said that enabling players to devise and share their creatures would make them care more about the game.  i don t want to put the player in the role of luke skywalker or frodo baggins - i want them to be george lucas or dr seuss   explained mr wright. few games have hinted at the scope of spore  but mr wright explained that he has nevertheless kept his development team small by hiring expert programmers. instead of employing lots of artists to create 3d models of the digital creatures  spore generates and displays the creatures according to rules devised by the programmers.  the thing i am coming away with [from the conference] is that next generation content is going to be really expensive  and creating it will drive the smaller players out of the market   said mr wright.  i d like to offer an alternative to that.   new development tools will be another important aid in making next generation games  and dozens of companies demonstrated their latest products at the conference.  oxford-based natural motion launched endorphin v2.0  which enables artists to direct a 3d  virtual actor . the actor is realistically modelled according to the laws of physics. endorphin simulates how the actor falls down stairs  for instance  or crumples up after a gunshot. artists can blend together these visual sequences  and include the results in their games. the process is much quicker than having an artist animate each movement by hand  and so lessens the need for larger art teams. another british company aiming to reduce the workload of artists is manchester start-up genemation. its latest tool  gencrowd  enables artists to create unique  photo-realistic human faces for games involving lots of people. gencrowd works by blending together elements of an in-built supply of stock faces of differing ages and ethnicities. the software can create up to 2 000 new heads an hour.  one area not yet dominated by graphical blockbusters is mobile phone games. even the latest phones are not as powerful as the consoles of a decade ago  so smaller teams of half a dozen people can still create complete games for the devices.  the game developers conference included a special two-day summit dedicated to creating mobile games. a niche attraction for a few dozen conference attendees when it began five years ago  gdc s mobile summit this year drew several hundred delegates. mobile games are a fast-growing sector because newer phones have better graphics and sound  and are thus more suitable for playing games. furthermore  the adoption of mobile phones continues to spread across the world. it s predicted that by 2006 two billion people will own a mobile phone. the growing importance of mobile gaming was reflected by a keynote given by john batter  general manager at ea mobile. ea mobile is a division of electronic arts  the biggest games publisher. until recently electronic arts had been dismissive of games for phones.  the last time you checked  ea wasn t in this business   mr batter admitted. but he said ea now planned on dominating the market by releasing mobile versions of its most popular franchises. ea plans to release up to 20 mobile games over the next 12 months. the first will be a version of its need for speed racing game  created by ea mobile s 30-person development team. mr batter predicted that by 2006  mobile phones would be capable of running games of comparable quality to those on sony s upcoming psp handheld console.  owain bennallack is the editor of develop magazine.,tech

247,donor attacks blair-brown  feud  the reported feud between tony blair and gordon brown has prompted a labour donor to say he will almost certainly refuse to give more funds.  duncan bannatyne also attacked the government over iraq and its  poor  response to the asian tsunami crisis. his broadside came as ex-foreign secretary robin cook said he hoped mr brown would be premier at some point. mr bannatyne has previously given labour £50 000. he made his fortune from care homes and health clubs.  the 52-year-old on tuesday said was he was reviewing his donations because of cabinet disunity and international issues. his spokesman said it was highly unlikely he would give labour more money  although he would remain a supporter and not fund the conservatives.  robert peston s new book has prompted more speculation about the blair-brown rift with its claims that the prime minister broke a promise made in 2003 to stand down. mr bannatyne said:  disunity in the cabinet has a corrosive effect on the country.  gordon brown is a great chancellor who has delivered a stable economy  but business wants that to continue and not be blown off course by petty squabbles based on personal ambition.  the businessman  whose latest venture is a casino in newcastle  also voiced concern about the ongoing violence in iraq.  and he branded the uk government s response to the tsunami as  piecemeal and poor .  the people there need practical help not just pledges of money   he said.  the us has forces helping on the ground - we can do more.  british navy ships have helped the relief effort and the prime minister has said the government could ultimately give hundreds of millions of pounds in aid. mr bannatyne is due to host a new television programme and is also appearing on bbc2 business start-up programme dragon s den. but his spokesman insisted his attack on labour was not a publicity stunt.  in a separate development  robin cook gave his support to mr brown s prime ministerial ambitions but told a lunch for political journalists winning the election had to be labour s election. but he insisted the recent squabbles between mr blair and mr brown were not  perceived as a problem by the voters   adding there was no impression of governmental incompetence. mr cook argued that more prominence was given to these matters because there was  not an alternative source of opposition to the government . he warned the  abstentions party  was the real challenge to labour - and they would not be motivated by mr blair s promise to produce an  unremittingly new labour  election manifesto. his comments come after dave prentis  the leader of britain s biggest union unison  told the daily record newspaper he wants a date to be set for mr blair to be replaced as labour leader.,politics

249,goldsmith denies war advice claim the attorney general has denied his statement to parliament about the legality of the iraq war was drafted by downing street officials.  lord goldsmith said lord falconer and baroness morgan played no part in drafting the answer. he added the answer represented his view that the war was legal  but was not a summary of his advice to the pm. the government has resisted calls to publish the full advice  saying such papers are always kept confidential.  in a statement  lord goldsmith said:  i was fully involved throughout the drafting process and personally finalised  and of course approved  the answer.  he said the answer had been prepared in his office with the involvement of solicitor general harriet harman  two of his own officials  three foreign office officials  a qc  christopher greenwood and the then lord chancellor  lord irvine of lairg.   no other minister or official was involved in any way.  he suggested the claim that lord falconer and lady morgan had drafted the answer were the result of a mis-transcription of his evidence to the butler inquiry into pre-war intelligence.  as i have always made clear  i set out in the answer my own genuinely held  independent view that military action was lawful under the existing (un) security council resolutions   he said.  the answer did not purport to be a summary of my confidential legal advice to government.  former foreign secretary robin cook said lord goldsmith s admission that his parliamentary answer was not a summary of his legal opinion suggested parliament may have been misled.  the attorney general may never have presented his answer as a summary  but others certainly did   he said.  what is clear from his statement today is that he does not believe that it was a full  accurate summary of his formal opinion.   earlier  tony blair dismissed questions about the attorney general s advice  and said his parliamentary statement had been a  fair summary  of his opinion.  that s what he (lord goldsmith) said and that s what i say. he has dealt with this time and time and time again   mr blair told his monthly news conference in downing street. he refused to answer further questions on the issue.  on the question of whether such papers have always been kept confidential  tory mp michael mates  who is a member of the commons intelligence and security committee and was part of the butler inquiry  told the bbc:  that  as a general rule  is right  but it s not an absolute rule.  he said there had been other occasions when advice had been published  most recently regarding prince charles s marriage plans. the government could not pick and choose when to use the convention  he said. mr mates added:  this may be one of those special occasions... when it would be in the public interest to see the advice which the attorney general gave to the prime minister.   the claims about lord falconer and baroness morgan s involvement were made in a book published this week by philippe sands qc  a member of cherie blair s matrix chambers. he also says lord goldsmith warned tony blair on 7 march 2003 that the iraq war could be illegal without a second un resolution sanctioning military action.  a short statement about lord goldsmith s position presented in a written parliamentary answer on 17 march 2003 - just before a crucial commons vote on the military action - did not suggest this. former minister clare short  who resigned from the government over the iraq war  said the ministerial answer was the same statement that was earlier shown to the cabinet as it discussed military action. she said the full advice should have been attached  according to the ministerial code  and demanded a lords inquiry into the matter. the conservatives and liberal democrats say they still want the publication of the full legal advice given by the attorney general. lib dem foreign affairs spokesman sir menzies campbell said lord goldsmith s statement still did not clear up the outstanding issues.  if his original advice of 7 march accepted that military action might be illegal  how was it that he resolved any such doubts by the time the parliamentary answer was published on 17 march   he said.  only the fullest disclosure will now do.,politics

 sony net minidisc! it paved the way for more mp3 player to explode onto the market. i always used my netmd  and could not go anywhere without it.  a laptop computer is not a gadget! it s a working tool!  the sinclair executive was the world s first pocket calculator. i think this should be there as well.  how about the clockwork radio  or gps  or a pocket calculator  all these things are useful to real people  not just pc magazine editors.  are the people who created this list insane   surely the most important gadget of the modern age is the mobile phone  it has revolutionalised communication  which is more than can be said for a niche market laptop. from outside the modern age  the marine chronometer is the single most important gadget  without which modern transportation systems would not have evolved so quickly.  has everyone forgot about the breville pie maker    an interesting list. of the electronic gadgets  thousands of journalists in the early 1980s blessed the original noteboook pc - the tandy 100. the size of a4 paper and light  three weeks on a set of batteries  an excellent keyboard  a modem. a pity tandy did not make it dos compatible.  what s an apple powerbook 100   it s out of date - not much of a  gadget . surely it has to be something simple / timeless - the tin opener  swiss army knife  safety razor blade  wristwatch or the thing for taking stones out of horses hooves    it has to be the mobile phone. no other single device has had such an effect on our way of living in such a short space of time.  the ball point pen has got to be one of the most used and common gadgets ever. also many might be grateful for the pocket calculator which was a great improvement over the slide rule.  the casio pocket calculator that played a simple game and made tinny noises was also a hot gadget in 1980. a true gadget  it could be carried around and shown off.  all top 10 are electronic toys  so the list is probably a better reflection of the current high-tech obsession than anyhting else. i say this as the swiss army knife only made no 20.  sinclair ql a machine far ahead of its time. the first home machine with a true multi-takings os. shame the marketing was so bad!!!  apple.. a triumph of fashion over... well everything else.  utter rubbish. yes  the apple laptop and sony walkman are classic gadgets. but to call the sextant and the marine chronometer  gadgets  and rank them as less important than a tv remote control reveals a quite shocking lack of historical perspective. the former literally helped change the world by vastly improving navigation at see. the latter is the seed around which the couch potato culture has developed. no competition.  i d also put apple s newton and the first palm pilot there as the front runners for portable computing  and possibly the toshiba libretto for the same reason. i only wish that vulcan inc s flipstart wasn t just vapourware otherwise it would be at the top.  how did a laptop ever manage to beat off the challenge of the wristwatch or the telephone (mobile or otherwise)  what about radios and tvs   the swiss army knife. by far the most useful gadget. i got mine 12 years ago. still wearing and using it a lot! it stood the test of time.  psion organiser series 3  should be up there. had a usable qwerty keyboard  removable storage  good set of apps and programmable. case design was good (batteries in the hinge - a first  i think). great product innovation.  the first mobile pc was voted best gadget by readers of...err... mobile pc ! why do you keep putting these obviously biased lists on your site  it s obviously the mobile phone or remote control  and readers of a less partisan publication would tell you that.  the motorola startac should be number one. why  there will be mobile phones long after notebook computers and other gadgets are either gone or integrated in communications devices.  the psion series 3c! the first most practical way to carry all your info around...  i too would back the sinclair spectrum - without this little beauty i would never have moved into the world of it and earn the living that i do now.  i d have put the mobile phone high up the list. probably a nokia model.  sinclair spectrum - 16k. it plugged into the tv. games were rubbish but it gave me a taste for programming and that s what i do for a living now.  i wish more modern notebooks -- even apple s newest offerings -- were more like the pb100. particularly disheartening is the demise of the trackball  which has given way to the largely useless  trackpad  which every notebook on the market today uses. they re invariably inaccurate  uncomfortable  and cumbersome to use.  congratulations to apple  a deserved win!,tech
252,how to smash a home computer an executive who froze his broken hard disk thinking it would be fixed has topped a list of the weirdest computer mishaps.  although computer malfunctions remain the most common cause of file loss  data recovery experts say human behaviour still is to blame in many cases. they say that no matter how effective technology is at rescuing files  users should take more time to back-up and protect important files. the list of the top 10 global data disasters was compiled by recovery company ontrack.  careless - and preventable - mistakes that result in data loss range from reckless file maintenance practices to episodes of pure rage towards a computer. this last category includes the case of a man who became so mad with his malfunctioning laptop that he threw it in the lavatory and flushed a couple of times.  data can disappear as a result of natural disaster  system fault or computer virus  but human error  including  computer rage   seems to be a growing problem   said adrian palmer  managing director of ontrack data recovery.   nevertheless  victims soon calm down when they realise the damage they ve done and come to us with pleas for help to retrieve their valuable information.  a far more common situation is when a computer virus strikes and leads to precious files being corrupted or deleted entirely. mr palmer recalled the case of a couple who had hundreds of pictures of their baby s first three months on their computer  but managed to reformat the hard drive and erase all the precious memories.  data can be recovered from computers  servers and even memory cards used in digital devices in most cases   said mr palmer.  however  individuals and companies can avoid the hassle and stress this can cause by backing up data on a regular basis.,tech
253,us airways staff agree to pay cut a union representing 5 200 flight attendants at bankrupt us airways have agreed to a new contract that cuts pay by nearly 10%.  the deal will help the carrier  trying to survive by cutting costs by nearly $1bn (£530m) a year  save about $94m. more than two thirds of its 28 000 staff have now accepted wage cuts. but talks are still continuing with a union representing mechanics  baggage handlers and cleaners  which has so far failed to negotiate a new contract. the seventh largest carrier in the us sought bankruptcy protection for a second time in two years last september. it had been one of the quickest to deal with difficulties faced by the aviation industry after the 9/11 attacks in 2001. but it emerged from chapter 11 bankruptcy in march 2003 to face competition from low-cost carriers and higher fuel costs. us airways management has said it may need to start liquidating assets if it does not receive concessions from all staff by the middle of this month.,business
254,labour s four little words labour has unveiled the four little words that will form the heart of its general election campaign which  for those just returned from the planet galifray  is  looming .  the slogan  britain forward not back  (no  it s not an instruction from one of those inter-planetary time lords) is to become as much a part of our daily lives as the sky - it s always there but we mostly stop noticing. the word  britain  is cast on a red background - a nod to old labour.  forward  is in italics and cunningly slopes forward and  along with  not back   is set against a mushy pea green background. as one of the journalists assembled at the unveiling declared  it was all very post modern  or something. great use of colour. those ad men really do earn their money. and  coincidentally  the ad men who came up with the abandoned flying pigs and so-called  fagin  posters which caused tory protests have not been sacked but  as election supremo alan milburn declared   are doing a very good job .  mr milburn  in the latest in his series of pre-election-campaign campaigning  explained the slogan was the reaction to polling which suggests the public believe labour and tony blair are the future while michael howard and the tories would take the country backwards.  not many people talk about the years before 1997 as the good old days   he declared. it would be an aggressive campaign because things would inevitably boil down to a choice between labour and the tories.  nobody  he claimed  could picture liberal democrat leader charles kennedy walking up downing street the day after polling. they could  however  picture michael howard or  of course  tony blair doing it. so it was only right that the campaign concentrated on rigorously examining the opposition s policies and past record. and tony blair would be in the very front line of that campaign  he said.  between now and the election the prime minister will be spending more time out of london than in it but in britain  not overseas   he promised.  he will be leading the domestic debate from the front  listening  taking the flak.  so  let s get on with it then.,politics

256,brown targets oaps and homebuyers gordon brown has doubled the level at which house buyers pay stamp duty to £120 000 as he put the economy at the heart of labour s election campaign.  the chancellor also unveiled a one-off £200 council tax refund for pensioners and a rise in child tax credit. mr brown put 1p a pint on beer  4p on a bottle of wine and 7p on 20 cigarettes but froze petrol duty until september. the tories called it a  vote now  pay later  budget. the lib dems branded it a  sticking plaster  for the election.  tory leader michael howard predicted the budget would do nothing to help labour s  faltering  election campaign.   this government and this chancellor have run out of solutions to the problems britain faces   mr howard told mps.  their only answer is to tax  to spend and to waste - to get people to vote now and pay later.  he ended his response with an election challenge to labour  saying  bring it on . liberal democrat leader charles kennedy attacked mr brown for failing to mention the environment and for his record on social justice.  how can it be right in britain today that the poorest 20% pay more in tax  as a proportion of their income  than the richest 20%   he asked.  mr kennedy criticised mr brown for failing to mention the  ticking bomb  of council tax revaluation  saying it was  high time  the system was replaced by a  local tax based on the ability to pay . during his 49 minute speech mr brown told mps he had defied the pundits by hitting his growth target of 3.1% for 2004.  he said his budget struck a balance  between tax cuts that are affordable  investments that are essential and stability that is paramount . he rejected across-the-board tax cuts in favour of targeted help for families. the child tax credit will rise in line with earnings  giving families an extra £5 a week. in contrast  the personal income tax allowance will rise only in line with inflation from £4 745 to £4 895 next month. mr brown told mps child benefit would rise to a maximum of £63 a week for the first child and £111 for two children. despite his giveaways  budget documents show mr brown clawed back £265m through a clampdown on tax avoidance and increased revenue from a windfall tax on oil companies. he also scrapped stamp duty relief for commercial property in disadvantaged areas - a measure brought in just over three years ago. bbc political editor andrew marr suggested the sweeteners were not big enough to have a transforming effect on voters. but trust in mr brown s economic stewardship would be a central election issue  he said.  mr brown also unveiled plans for a memorial to the queen mother  funded through a special coin to celebrate the queen s 80th birthday. other measures include equal tax status for same-sex couples and a deal with the council of mortgage lenders to boost low cost home ownership. the level where people start paying inheritance tax will also rise from £263 000 to £275 000 from april. mr brown said he had met his financial  golden rule  with a £6bn surplus and he said public borrowing would continue to fall over the next five years.  the economy had grown for 50 consecutive quarters  he said  and was forecast to continue doing so over the next year  with a forecast of 3% to 3.5% in 2005 and 2.5% to 3% in 2006. the first £2bn of value-for-money savings identified in the gershon review have been achieved  the chancellor said. some 12 500 civil servant posts have been axed  and 7 800 relocated out of the south east of england  he added. snp leader alex salmond said mr brown had failed the  tartan test  as there were no measures to boost the scottish economy. simon thomas  of plaid cymru  called it a budget for middle england. uk independence party leader roger knapman attacked the plans for pensioners saying they needed  more money and the dignity of being allowed to spend it how they want   not  free bus rides . the green party said the budget was a  wasted opportunity  for environmental protection  adding:  brown obviously has an eye on the coming election  and has taken his eye off the needs of the planet.,politics

258,high fuel costs hit us airlines two of the largest airlines in the us - american and southwest - have blamed record fuel prices for their disappointing quarterly results.  american airlines  parent amr reported a loss of $387m (£206m) for the fourth quarter of 2004  against a $111m loss for the same period a year earlier. meanwhile  southwest airlines saw its fourth-quarter 2004 profits fall 15% to $56m  against $66m a year earlier. both said high fuel bills would continue to pressure revenues in 2005. american  the world s biggest airline by some measures  said it expected to report a loss for the first quarter of 2005. southwest  which has the highest market value of any us carrier  said it would remain profitable despite high fuel prices.  amr s shares were flat in wednesday morning trading on the new york stock exchange  as the results were slightly better than analysts had anticipated. amr s chief executive gerard arpey said the airline s difficulties reflected the situation within the industry.  amr s results for the fourth quarter of 2004 reflect the economic woes that plagued the airline industry throughout 2004 - in particular  high fuel prices and a tough revenue environment   he said. for the full year  amr posted a loss of $761m  lower than 2003 s $1.2bn loss and an indication that the airline has successfully cut costs. amr added that as part of its cost cutting measures  it is postponing the delivery of 54 boeing jets. shares in southwest fell 65 cents to $14.35 as analysts voiced their disappointment.  the results came in below our already conservative estimate for the quarter   said ray neidl  an analyst at calyon securities. both american and southwest have been squeezed by cut-throat competition in the us airline industry  as a glut of available seats has led to fierce price reductions.,business

260,us retail sales surge in december us retail sales ended the year on a high note with solid gains in december  boosted by strong car sales.  seasonally adjusted sales rose 1.2% in the month  compared to 0.1% a month earlier  boosted by a surge in shopping just before and after christmas. sales climbed 8% for the year  the best performance since an 8.5% rise in 1999  the commerce department added. the gains were led by a 4.3% jump in auto sales as dealers used enhanced offers to get cars out of showrooms. dealers were forced to cut prices in december to maintain sales growth in a tough quarter when the usual end-of-year holiday sales boom was slow to get started.  the increase in sales during december pushed total spending for the month to $349.4bn (£265.9bn). sales for the year also broke through the $4 trillion mark for the first time - with annual sales coming in at $4.06 trillion however  if automotives are excluded from december s data  retail sales rose just 0.3% on the month. home furnishings and furniture stores also performed well  rising 2.2%. but as well as hitting the shops  more us consumers were going online or using mail order for their purchases - with non-store retailers seeing sales rise by 1.9%. however  analysts said that the strong figures were unlikely to put the federal reserve bank off its current policy of measured interest rate rises.  consumers for now remain willing to spend freely  sustaining the us expansion. given that attitude  the fed remains likely to continue boosting the fed funds rate at upcoming meetings   ubs economist maury harris told reuters.  retail sales are seen as a major part of consumer spending - which in turn makes up two-thirds of economic output in the us. consumer spending has been picking up in recent years after slumping during 2001 and 2002 as the country battled to recover from its first recession of the decade and the world trade centre attacks. during that time  sales grew a lacklustre 2.9% in 2001 and 2.5% a year later. looking ahead  analysts now expect improvement in jobs growth to feed through to the high street with consumer spending remaining strong. the belief comes despite the latest labor department report showing a surprise rise in unemployment. the number of americans filing initial jobless claims jumped to 367 000  the highest rate since september. however  long-term claims slipped to their lowest level since 2001.,business
261,gadget market  to grow in 2005  the explosion in consumer technology is to continue into 2005  delegates at the world s largest gadget show  in las vegas  have been told.  the number of gadgets in the shops is predicted to grow by 11%  while devices which talk to each other will become increasingly important.  everything is going digital   kirsten pfeifer from the consumer electronics association  told the bbc news website. the consumer electronics show (ces) featured the pick of 2005 s products.  consumers are controlling what they want and technologies like hdtvs [high-definition tvs]  digital radio  and digital cameras will remain strong in 2005.  all the products on show really showed the breadth and depth of the industry.  despite showing diversity  some delegates attending complained that the showcase lacked as much  wow factor  as in previous years.  the portable technologies on show also reflected one of the buzzwords of ces  which was the  time and place shifting  of multimedia content - being able to watch and listen to video and music anywhere  at any time. at the start of last year s ces  the cea predicted there would be an average growth of 4% in 2004. that figure was surpassed with the rise in popularity of portable digital music players  personal video recorders and digital cameras. it was clear also that gadgets are becoming a lot more about lifestyle choice  with fashion and personalisation becoming increasingly key to the way gadgets are designed. part of this has been the rise in spending power of the  generation x-ers  who have grown up with technology and who now have the spending power and desire for more devices that suit them. more than 57% of the consumer electronics market is made up of female buyers  according to cea research. hybrid devices  which combine a number of multimedia functions  were also in evidence on the show floor.  a lot of this is driven by just the ability to do it   said stephen baker  a consumer electronics analyst with retail research firm npd group.  some of these functions cost next to nothing to add.   as well as the show floor showcasing everything from tiny wearable mp3 players to giant high-definition tvs  several keynote speeches were made by industry leaders  such as microsoft chief bill gates. despite several embarrassing technical glitches during mr gate s pre-show speech  he announced several new partnerships - mainly for the us market. he unveiled new ways of letting people take tv shows recorded on personal video recorders and watch them back on portable devices. he disappointed some  however  by failing to announce any details of the next generation of the xbox games console. another disappointment was the lack of exposure sony s new portable games device  the psp  had at the show. sony said the much-anticipated gadget would most likely start shipping in march for the us and europe. it went on sale in japan before christmas. there were only two psps embedded in glass cabinets at the show though and no representatives to discuss further details. a sony representative told the bbc news website this was because sony did not consider it to be part of their  consumer technology  offering.  elsewhere at the show  there was a plethora of colour and plasma screens  including samsung s 102-inch (2.6 metre) plasma - the largest in the world. industry experts were also excited about high-definition technologies coming to the fore in 2005  with new formats for dvds coming out which will hold six times as much data as conventional dvds. with so many devices on the move there were a lot of products on show offering external storage  like seagate s 5gb pocket sized external hard drive  which won an innovation for engineering and design prize. more than 120 000 trade professionals attended ces in las vegas  which officially ran from 6 to 9 january.,tech

266,dollar drops on reserves concerns the us dollar has dropped against major currencies on concerns that central banks may cut the amount of dollars they hold in their foreign reserves.  comments by south korea s central bank at the end of last week have sparked the recent round of dollar declines. south korea  which has about $200bn in foreign reserves  said it plans instead to boost holdings of currencies such as the australian and canadian dollar. analysts reckon that other nations may follow suit and now ditch the dollar. at 1300 gmt  the euro was up 0.9% on the day at 1.3187 euros per us dollar. the british pound had added 0.5% to break through the $1.90 level  while the dollar had fallen by 1.3% against the japanese yen to trade at 104.16 yen.  at the start of the year  the us currency  which had lost 7% against the euro in the final three months of 2004 and had fallen to record lows  staged something of a recovery.  analysts  however  pointed to the dollar s inability recently to extend that rally despite positive economic and corporate data  and highlighted the fact that many of the us s economic problems had not disappeared. the focus once again has been on the country s massive trade and budget deficits  with predictions of more dollar weakness to come.  the comments from korea came at a time when sentiment towards the dollar was already softening   said ian gunner  a trader at mellon financial. on tuesday  traders in asia said that both south korea and taiwan had withdrawn their bids to buy dollars at the start of the session. mansoor mohi-uddin  chief currency strategist at ubs  said that there was a sentiment in the market that  central banks from asia and the middle east are buying euros . a report last month already showed that the dollar was losing its allure as a currency that offered rock-steady returns and stability. compiled by central banking publications and sponsored by the uk s royal bank of scotland  the survey found 39 nations out of 65 questioned were increasing their euro holdings  with 29 cutting back on the us dollar.,business
267,businesses fail to plan for hiv companies fail to draw up plans to cope with hiv/aids until it affects 20% of people in a country  new research says.  the finding comes in a report published on thursday by the world economic forum  harvard and the un aids agency.  too few companies are responding proactively to the social and business threats   said dr kate taylor  head of the wef s global health initiative. nearly 9 000 business leaders in 104 countries were surveyed for business and hiv/aids: commitment and action   dr taylor described the level of action taken by businesses as revealed by the report as  too little  too late . the issue will be highlighted to business and world leaders at the world economic forum  which meets in davos  switzerland  next week. the wef report shows that despite the fact that 14 000 people contract hiv/aids every day  concern among businesses has dropped by 23% in the last 12 months. most (71%) have no policies in place to address the disease. nor could over 65% of the business leaders surveyed say or estimate the prevalence of hiv among their staff. the un programme tackling aids  unaids  pointed out that having a clear strategy for dealing with hiv/aids was a good investment as well as being socially responsible.  one company that does have a plan is anglo-american  the international mining company  which estimates an hiv prevalence of 24% among its 130 000-strong southern african workforce.  over the last two years the company has implemented extensive voluntary counselling and testing for hiv infection  coupled with anti-retroviral therapy for employees progressing to aids. over 90% of the 2 200 employees who have accessed and remained on treatment are well and have returned to normal work.  effective action on hiv/aids is synonymous with good business management and leads to more profitable and sustainable operations   said brian brink  senior vice-president  health  at anglo-american.   companies should encourage all workers to know their hiv status  making it as routine as monitoring blood pressure or cholesterol   he said.  providing access to treatment is a critical part of this.  across sub-saharan africa  even in countries with an hiv prevalence of 10-19%  only around 7% of companies have formal hiv/aids policies in place  according to the report. the gap is even wider in china  ethiopia  india  nigeria and russia  the so-called  next wave  countries  which are predicted to experience the highest numbers of new hiv/aids cases worldwide by 2010. the report adds  an important building block to our understanding of how the business community is experiencing the hiv/aids epidemic and to whether and how it is reacting   said david bloom  professor of economics and demography at the harvard school of public health.  the wef report concludes that businesses need to understand their exposure to hiv/aids risks and come up with good local practices to manage them. a key priority  in both high and low-prevalence settings  said the wef is to establish a policy based on non-discrimination and confidentiality.,business
268,cable offers video-on-demand cable firms ntl and telewest have both launched video-on-demand services as the battle between satellite and cable tv heats up.  movies from sony pictures  walt disney  touchstone  miramax  columbia and buena vista will be among those on offer. the service is similar to sky plus  as users can pause  fast forward and rewind content  but they cannot store programmes on their set top box - yet. it could sound the death knell for some tv channels  telewest predicts.  it allows us to demonstrate a clear competitive advantage over sky for the first time in many years   said telewest chief executive eric tveter.   video-on-demand will offer a deeper range of content than currently exists on tv. there will be less compromising around the tv schedule and some of the less popular channels may go by the wayside   said philip snalune  director of products at telewest. telewest customers in bristol and ntl viewers in glasgow will be the first to test the new service  which sees a raft of movies on offer for 24 hour rental. during the year  the service will be extended to all cable regions. films will range in price from £1 or £2 for archived movies to £3.50 for current releases. new releases initially on offer will include 50 first dates  kill bill: volume 2  gothika and the station agent. in addition  ntl is offering children s programmes  adult content  music video and concerts. telewest will launch similar services later in the year. ntl is also offering viewers the chance to catch up with programmes they have missed. its pick of the week service will offer a selection of bbc programmes from the previous seven days such as eastenders  casualty  top gear and antiques roadshow. the bbc is trialling a similar service  offering broadband users the chance to watch programmes already broadcast on their pc. for telewest it is the beginning of a £20m investment in tv-on-demand which will also see the launch of a personal video recorder (pvr). pvr has been a big success for sky because it gives customers control over programmes. satellite customers without pvr cannot pause  rewind or fast forward their programmes.  with both services on offer from telewest  mr tveter is confident the cable firm can dent not just the viewing figures for terrestrial tv but also gain a huge competitive advantage over sky.   we offer the best of both worlds and most households have an interest in having both video-on-demand and pvr   he said. video rental stores may also have to watch their back.  video-on-demand is better than having a video-store in your living room and is more convenient   he said. ntl said it had not ruled out the possibility of offering a pvr but for the moment is concentrating on video-on-demand.  pvr is a recording mechanism whereas what we are offering is truly on demand   said a spokesman for the company. video-on-demand has the added advantage of not requiring a separate set-top box or extra remote controls  he added. adam thomas  an analyst at research firm informa media believes the time is ripe for video-on-demand to flourish.  while sky will remain the dominant force in uk pay tv for some time to come  ntl and telewest seem well placed to successfully ride this second wave of vod enthusiasm and  if marketed correctly  this could help them eat into sky s lead   he said.,tech

270,blair pledges unity to labour mps tony blair has sought to reassure labour backbenchers that nothing will stand in the way of the party s bid for a third term in power.  mr blair was speaking to mps amid fresh rumours of a rift with gordon brown. a new book says the prime minister went back on a pledge to mr brown to stand down before the next general election. the chancellor has said he is focused on winning the poll and is due to join election supremo alan milburn for a labour poster launch this week. mr blair told the parliamentary labour party (plp) on monday:  i know from everyone here  in cabinet and government  nothing is going to get in the way of a unified labour party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need.  the prime minister and his chancellor arrived within seconds of each other and seemingly in good spirits at the start of the meeting which lasted around an hour. a new book  brown s britain by sunday telegraph journalist robert peston  says mr blair went back on a pledge to make way for mr brown after cabinet allies intervened in june 2004.  it has caused a new wave of concern among labour mps gearing up to defend their seats in an election  widely expected to be held in may  and several members are understood to have lined up to express their discontent at the plp meeting. health secretary john reid earlier warned that labour members would not easily forgive anybody fuelling damaging speculation. he told bbc news:  those who co-operate or inspire these books  in my view  have to know that  whatever the short-term political or personal advantage that they think they might secure  they always do it by damaging the record  the unity and the re-election chances of the labour party and the government.  mr blair on sunday dismissed claims of broken promises  saying:  i ve dealt with this six months ago. i said then you don t do deals over jobs like this - you don t.   in a separate bbc interview  mr brown said he and the prime minister would not be distracted by  gossip .  it s very important that we all do what we can in a unified way to ensure the election of a labour government   he said.  on monday  mr blair s spokesman said:  the prime minister is determined that he will get on with the business of government because he believes that what people want.  mr brown says he discussed the election campaign with mr blair on saturday and promised to play his part.  mr peston said the pair had  mutual animosity and contempt . mr blair had decided in november 2003 he would quit because he felt he had lost voters  trust because of the iraq war.  he had then changed his mind in june 2004  following intervention from cabinet allies and suspicion that the chancellor was manoeuvring against him. mr brown allegedly said he could no longer believe anything mr blair told him. conservative co-chairman liam fox likened the two men to  self-obsessed schoolboys . liberal democrat parliamentary chairman matthew taylor said their personal ambition was  getting in the way of good government . ex-labour leader neil kinnock said mr blair and mr brown could only deal with the media frenzy by continuing to say they would not allow a row to damage labour or british interests. he told bbc radio five live that mr brown would never encourage any kind of insurrection or coup.,politics
271,blair dismisses quit claim report tony blair has dismissed reports he told gordon brown he would quit before the next general election.   you don t do deals over jobs like this   the prime minister told bbc one s breakfast with frost programme. according to a new book  brown s britain  mr blair went back on a pledge to make way for mr brown after cabinet allies intervened in june 2004. mr blair said the claims were  reheated from six months ago  and that he was concentrating on running the country. mr blair said:  i ve dealt with this six months ago. i said then you don t do deals over jobs like this - you don t.   what both of us are actually concentrating on are the issues that concern the country.  the book  by sunday telegraph journalist robert peston and serialised in the newspaper  said the pair had  mutual animosity and contempt  for each other.  it claims tony blair felt by november 2003 he had lost voters  trust because of the iraq war and that he was no longer an asset to the labour party. and that at a dinner hosted by deputy prime minister john prescott he told mr brown of his intention to stand down. according to mr peston the prime minister said:  help me to get through the year and i will then stand down.  but he then changed his mind in june 2004  following intervention from allies in the cabinet and the suspicion that the chancellor was deliberately manoeuvring against him  according to the book.  mr peston told bbc news:  my understanding is that they are not nearly as close or as friendly as they once were.  what the book says is there is now a pretty profound mutual mistrust  mutual animosity.  i think in public you see this double-act pretending everything is alright  but in private i don t think the relationship is good because brown  understandably  feels deeply betrayed - particularly over this issue of the leadership.  but  in a wide-ranging bbc interview covering issues such as the asian tsunami disaster  the middle east peace process and northern ireland  mr blair said:  when you get to the top in politics you get this huge swell around you.  all sorts of people make all sorts of claims and counter-claims.  he admitted to a  sense of frustration  about the allegations which he said had been made  countless times .  there has been fresh speculation of a rift recently  following their separate responses to the asian tsunami. these rumours were fuelled by mr blair s decision to hold his monthly media conference at the same time as a long-planned speech by mr brown on uk plans to tackle global poverty with a new  marshall plan  for africa. there was speculation the pair were trying to outdo each other s response to the disaster. but the prime minister said he had discussed these claims with the chancellor and dismissed them as a  load of nonsense . former welfare minister frank field mp said the prime minister should sack mr brown  but did not believe mr blair was strong enough to do so.  tory leader michael howard accused the prime minister and mr brown of  squabbling like schoolboys . he told sky news  sunday with adam boulton:  this is the politics of the playground and britain really does deserve better.  the liberal democrat parliamentary chairman matthew taylor said the personal ambition of mr blair and mr brown was  getting in the way of good government .  either they need to grow up and put their squabbles to one side or they cannot expect the electorate to support a divided government at the next election.  during the interview mr blair also said the former home secretary david blunkett would play a  big role  at the general election.,politics
272,us to probe airline travel chaos the us government is to investigate two airlines- us airways and delta air lines  comair subsidiary - after travel chaos over the christmas weekend.  staff calling in sick at us airways and computer failures at comair left 30 000 passengers stranded and 10 000 pieces of baggage undelivered. us airways is in chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time in two years  and battling to cut costs. it is currently trying to negotiate pay cuts with flight and baggage staff.  transportation secretary norman mineta said he was  deeply concerned  at the disruption to passengers  and ordered a thorough investigation. comair s computer breakdown plunged its flight-crew scheduling system into disarray. altogether  some 1 100 flights were cancelled over the holiday long weekend. mr mineta said it was important to understand  what happened  why it happened and whether the carriers properly planned for the holiday travel period and responded appropriately to consumer needs in the aftermath .  adding to the atmosphere of chaos were mountains of luggage left to pile up when a third of us airways  baggage handling staff called in sick. there was also a shortage of us airways flight attendants  with nearly a fifth saying they were too sick to work  leading to many flight cancellations. however  union officials denied there had been a deliberate  sickout . they said that many people have flu at this time of year and that the airline is chronically understaffed.  us airways ended up cancelling over 100 flights on christmas day  stranding passengers in as many as 119 airports. ground crews at us airways  the seventh-largest us airline  which is now in chapter 11 bankruptcy protection  face a court-imposed pay cut next month. the airline needs to negotiate other paycuts if it is to find a route out of bankruptcy. it is looking for paycuts totalling $800m.   us airways has a full-scale employee mutiny on its hands   commented michael boyd  an industry consultant. disruptions to flight schedules could discourage customers from flying with us airways  reducing revenues. us airways had to cancel approximately 65 flights on thursday  180 on friday  140 on saturday  43 on sunday and 15 on monday  said industry officials. the airline said it was  embarrassed by the situation  and  deeply regrets any inconvenience caused to customers   the probe will focus on the industry s compliance with a 1999 agreement aimed at improving the quality of passenger service that has so far allowed airlines to avoid congressionally-mandated standards. analysts said the christmas chaos cast doubt on us airway s ability to emerge from bankruptcy - and was likely to worsen the finances of troubled delta  parent of comair. comair  deeply regrets the inconvenience to all of our customers caused by the severe winter storm in the ohio river valley during the busy holiday season  exacerbated by problems with the airline s crew scheduling system  causing additional flight delays and cancellations   the delta subsidiary said in a statement.,business
273,blinx sequel purrs nicely the original blinx was intended to convert many platform game lovers to microsoft s then new xbox console.  its sharp graphics and novel gameplay  with the main character able to pause  slow  rewind and fast-forward time  were meant to lure many fans to the new machine. but poor design meant the game became a very frustrating affair with players often stranded half-way through a level without the required tools to finish. thankfully  the sequel has fixed many of the original faults. this time around you do not play as blinx but instead you are given the chance to create two unique cat characters and two pig characters.  the character generator is very detailed and a few minutes of tweaking and adjusting will create a unique personality to unleash on the game.  as the game progresses you swap between the two rival factions  pig and feline  assuming the role of your created characters. the thrust of the game sees the two factions competing to recover pieces of a missing time crystal. as in the original  your feline persona can control time  but this time the pigs get to control space. there are a number of puzzles which require control over time to solve while the pigs can create things such as warps  space bubbles and void traps in order to progress. the control over space and time is achieved through a number of vcr-style icons and is quite intuitive.  annoyingly  the puzzles are a little too obviously flagged up and most gamers will find it more of a chore than a challenge to solve them. the game has also tried to emulate franchises such as jak and daxter and ratchet and clank on ps2 and so there are a number of combat elements. these are a little predictable and tend to drag the general polish of the game down to a more dulled affair. but the game s excellent graphics  easily the best-looking platform game around  sound and dollops of humour make it an attractive game for younger platform fans.  blinx 2 is out on xbox now.,tech
274,burglar defence guidelines issued householders who injure or even kill intruders are unlikely to be prosecuted - providing they were acting  honestly and instinctively   new guidelines say.  the law also protects those who use  something to hand  as a weapon. the leaflet  published by police and prosecutors  aims to combat confusion about current legislation  which lets people use  reasonable force . the guidance  relating to england and wales  follows a recent decision by ministers not to change the law. doing what you  honestly and instinctively  believed was necessary would be the strongest evidence of acting lawfully  the guidance said.  and the law protects those who use  something to hand  as a weapon  said the leaflet published jointly by the crown prosecution service (cps) and association of chief police officers (acpo).  as a general rule  the more extreme the circumstances and fear felt  the more force can be used lawfully in self-defence  it said  adding that householders do not have to wait to be attacked before defending themselves. but knocking someone unconscious then killing them or hurting them further  or setting a trap for an intruder without involving the police were given as examples of  excessive and gratuitous  force. the tories have called for a change in the law so householders are only prosecuted if they use  grossly disproportionate  force. their demands have been backed by former metropolitan police commissioner sir john stevens. tory frontbencher patrick mercer is now pursuing the proposal through a private member s bill in parliament.  the government instead mounted a publicity campaign to clear up public uncertainty after a review concluded no law change was necessary. home secretary charles clarke said:  i believe in that old adage  an englishman s home is his castle . that s exactly what should be the case and i believe the current law provides that.  an  informal trawl  of cps records found 11 people had been prosecuted after attacking intruders in the past 15 years  five of whom were convicted. they included a man who laid in wait for a burglar on commercial premises in cheshire  before beating him up  throwing him into a pit and setting him on fire.  a cps spokesperson said the figures were not definitive because prosecutions are not listed according to whether they were committed by a householder on an intruder. in one of britain s highest profile cases  norfolk farmer tony martin was jailed for life for murdering 16-year-old burglar fred barras  in 1999. the conviction was later reduced to manslaughter on appeal and the sentence cut to five years. mr martin was freed from prison in july 2003. the guidance published on tuesday  said the police had a duty to investigate all incidents involving a death or injury. in cases involving householders attacking intruders prosecutors and police were  determined  they would be dealt with  as swiftly and as sympathetically as possible   it said.,politics

279,looks and music to drive mobiles mobile phones are still enjoying a boom time in sales  according to research from technology analysts gartner.  more than 674 million mobiles were sold last year globally  said the report  the highest total sold to date. the figure was 30% more than in 2003 and surpassed even the most optimistic predictions  gartner said. good design and the look of a mobile  as well as new services such as music downloads  could go some way to pushing up sales in 2005  said analysts. although people were still looking for better replacement phones  there was evidence  according to gartner  that some markets were seeing a slow-down in replacement sales.   all the markets grew apart from japan which shows that replacement sales are continuing in western europe   mobile analyst carolina milanesi told the bbc news website.  japan is where north america and western european markets can be in a couple of years  time.  they already have tv  music  ringtones  cameras  and all that we can think of on mobiles  so people have stopped buying replacement phones.   but there could be a slight slowdown in sales in european and us markets too  according to gartner  as people wait to see what comes next in mobile technology. this means mobile companies have to think carefully about what they are offering in new models so that people see a compelling reason to upgrade  said gartner. third generation mobiles (3g) with the ability to handle large amounts of data transfer  like video  could drive people into upgrading their phones  but ms milanesi said it was difficult to say how quickly that would happen.  at the end of the day  people have cameras and colour screens on mobiles and for the majority of people out there who don t really care about technology the speed of data to a phone is not critical.  nor would the rush to produce two or three megapixel camera phones be a reason for mobile owners to upgrade on its own. the majority of camera phone models are not at the stage where they can compete with digital cameras which also have flashes and zooms.  more likely to drive sales in 2005 would be the attention to design and aesthetics  as well as music services. the motorola razr v3 phone was typical of the attention to design that would be more commonplace in 2005  she added. this was not a  women s thing   she said  but a desire from men and women to have a gadget that is a form of self-expression too. it was not just about how the phone functioned  but about what it said about its owner.  western europe has always been a market which is quite attentive to design   said ms milanesi.   people are after something that is nice-looking  and together with that  there is the entertainment side.  this year music will have a part to play in this.  the market for full-track music downloads was worth just $20 million (£10.5 million) in 2004  but is set to be worth $1.8 billion (£94 million) by 2009  according to juniper research. sony ericsson just released its walkman branded mobile phone  the w800  which combines a digital music player with up to 30 hours  battery life  and a two megapixel camera. in july last year  motorola and apple announced a version of itunes online music downloading service would be released which would be compatible with motorola mobile phones. apple said the new itunes music player would become motorola s standard music application for its music phones. but the challenge will be balancing storage capacity with battery life if mobile music hopes to compete with digital music players like the ipod. ms milanesi said more models would likely be released in the coming year with hard drives. but they would be more likely to compete with the smaller capacity music players that have around four gigabyte storage capacity  which would not put too much strain on battery life.,tech
280,worldcom bosses  $54m payout ten former directors at worldcom have agreed to pay $54m (£28.85m)  including $18m from their own pockets  to settle a class action lawsuit  reports say.  james wareham  a lawyer representing one of the directors  told reuters the 10 had agreed to pay those who lost billions when the firm collapsed. the remaining $36m will be paid by the directors  insurers. but  a spokesman for the prosecutor  new york state comptroller alan hevesi  said no formal agreement had been made.  corporate governance experts said that if the directors do dip into their own pockets for the settlement  it will set a new standard for the accountability of bosses  when the firms they oversee face problems.   directors very rarely pay   said charles elson  chairman of the center for corporate governance at the university of delaware. he added that the settlement  sends a pretty strong shockwave through the director world . a formal agreement on the payout is expected to be signed on thursday in a us district court in manhattan. earlier  the new york times had reported that the personal payments were required as part of any deal at the start of negotiations. the ten former outside directors are james allen  judith areen  carl aycock  max bobbitt  clifford alexander  stiles kellett  gordon macklin  john porter  lawrence tucker and the estate of john sidgmore  who died last year. it has not yet been determined how much each director will have to pay.  none of the 10 former directors was a direct participant in the accounting machinations of the worldcom fraud   said the wall street journal (wsj).  two other outside former directors  bert roberts and francesco galesi  remain defendants in the lawsuit  said the newspaper. according to the wsj  which cites people familiar to the case  the settling directors are expected to deny wrongdoing and state they are settling the case to eliminate the uncertainties and expense of further litigations. the second-largest us long-distance telecoms operator filed for bankruptcy in 2002 when an $11bn accounting scandal was unearthed. the company emerged from chapter 11 protection last year and changed its name to mci inc. former worldcom chief executive bernard ebbers is to face trial this month on criminal charges that he oversaw the fraud.,business

294,security scares spark browser fix microsoft is working on a new version of its internet explorer web browser.  the revamp has been prompted by microsoft s growing concern with security as well as increased competition from rival browsers. microsoft said the new version will be far less vulnerable to the bugs that make its current browser a favourite of tech-savvy criminals. test versions of the new program  called ie 7  are due to be released by the summer.  the announcement about internet explorer was made by bill gates  microsoft chairman and chief software architect  during a keynote speech at the rsa security conference currently being held in san francisco. although details were scant  mr gates  said ie7 would include new protections against viruses  spyware and phishing scams. this last category of threats involves criminals setting up spoof websites that look identical to those of banks and try to trick people into handing over login and account information.  in a bid to shore up the poor security in ie 6  microsoft has regularly issued updates to patch loopholes exploited by criminals and the makers of nuisance programs such as spyware. earlier this month it released a security bulletin that patched eight critical security holes - some of which were found in the ie browser. microsoft has also made a series of acquisitions of small firms that specialise in computer security. one of the first fruits of these acquisitions appeared last month with the release of a microsoft anti-spyware program. an own-brand anti-virus program is due to follow by the end of 2005. the decision to make internet explorer 7 is widely seen as a u-turn because  before now  microsoft said it had no need to update the browser. typically new versions of its browser appear with successive versions of the windows operating system. a new version of ie was widely expected to debut with the next version of windows  codenamed longhorn  which is due to appear in 2006. the current version of internet explorer is four years old  and is widely seen as falling behind rivals such as firefox and opera. there are also persistent rumours that search engine google is poised to produce its own brand browser based on firefox. in particular the firefox browser has been winning fans and users since its first full version was released in november 2004. estimates of how many users firefox has won over vary widely. according to market statistics gathered by websidestory  firefox s market share is now about 5% of all users. however  other browser stat gatherers say the figure is closer to 15%. some technical websites report that a majority of their visitors use the firefox browser. internet explorer still dominates with a share of about 90% but this is down from a peak of almost 96% in mid-2004.,tech
